Here's a comprehensive explanation:\n\n**What is Software Asset Management (SAM)?**\n\nSoftware Asset Management (SAM) is a strategic approach to managing an organization’s software investments. It’s more than just tracking licenses; it’s about optimizing the entire lifecycle of software – from procurement to disposal – to ensure you’re using the right software, paying the right price, and minimizing risk.\n\n**Here’s a breakdown of the key components and what SAM involves:**\n\n**1. Core Activities:**\n\n* **Discovery & Inventory:**  This is the foundation. SAM tools automatically scan your network to identify *all* software installed – both licensed and unlicensed. This includes everything from operating systems and applications to plugins and updates.\n* **License Management:**  SAM tracks your software licenses (volume licenses, subscriptions, etc.) and compares them to the software installed. This identifies gaps (under-licensed) and over-licensing.\n* **Compliance Management:**  Ensuring you’re adhering to the terms of your software licenses is crucial. SAM helps you avoid costly audits and penalties from software vendors.\n* **Optimization:**  This is where SAM really shines. It identifies opportunities to:\n    * **Reduce Costs:**  By identifying unused licenses, consolidating licenses, and negotiating better deals with vendors.\n    * **Improve Efficiency:**  By streamlining software deployment and ensuring users have the right tools", "em_loose": 0.0, "em_strict": 0.0, "f1": 0.38053097345132736, "generation_ms": 6964, "mode": "base"}

In a healthy liver, these lobules are relatively uniform and round.\n\n2. **Tree-like Structure:** In cirrhosis, the lobules become distorted and irregular. They start to branch out in a haphazard, tree-like pattern.  The central vein of each lobule becomes displaced and often appears as a “trunk.”\n\n3. **Buds (Portal Triads):**  The portal triads are structures at the corners of each lobule that contain:\n   * **Arterial Supply:**  The hepatic artery brings blood to the liver.\n   * **Portal Vein:** This vein", "em_loose": 0.0, "em_strict": 0.0, "f1": 0.0660377358490566, "generation_ms": 6878, "mode": "base"}

He then combined “Joy” (from the poem) with “Division” to create “Joy Division.”\n\n*   **Ian Curtis’s Approval:** Ian Curtis, the band’s vocalist and songwriter, loved the name and embraced it fully. He felt it perfectly encapsulated the band’s themes of alienation, despair, and the struggle for connection.\n\nSo, in essence, “Joy Division” is a deliberately paradoxical name – a juxtaposition of happiness and division – reflecting the band’s complex and often troubled artistic vision.\n\nWould you like to know more about the band’s history or a specific aspect of their music?", "em_loose": 0.0, "em_strict": 0.0, "f1": 0.3090909090909091, "generation_ms": 5849, "mode": "base"}
