Approximately 1,500 sailors perished.\n* **Salvage and Early Claims:** Pirates, including Henry Jennings, initially attempted to scavenge the wreckage. Jennings faced accusations of piracy for his actions.\n* **Early Exploration & Exhibits:** Kip Wagner’s team began systematically exploring and documenting the wrecks in the 1960s, culminating in a prominent exhibit at the National Geographic Explorers Hall.

This goes beyond simple installations and considers *how* the software is being used (e.g., by number of users, processors, or CPU cores).\n\n**Key Components & Technologies:**\n\n* **ISO Standards:** The ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards provides a framework for ITAM (including SAM) processes and policies.
