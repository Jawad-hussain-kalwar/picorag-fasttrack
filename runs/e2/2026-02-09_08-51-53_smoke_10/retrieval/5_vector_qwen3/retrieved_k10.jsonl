An Inca temple 125 feet high, 225 feet wide, and 45,000 square feet in area was constructed. Having spent a great deal of money on a film that turned out to be a critical and financial disaster, Universal used the set again, recycling it into an Egyptian temple for \"The Mummy's Hand\" (1940). Whale made only one more completed film after this, the 1941 World War II romantic melodrama \"They Dare Not Love\", starring George Brent as an exiled Austrian prince fighting the Nazis. Plot. A group of adventurers journey deep into the South American jungle in search of ancient Incan treasure. A beautiful woman, brought to their camp by hired bearers, has come to join her husband, a newer member of the group, who was recently killed by hostile natives. As the months pass, jealousies and tempers flare as fights break out over the woman. The Incan treasure is eventually found but the treasure-seekers, now united by a common enemy, are about to be attacked by hordes of fierce natives armed with bows and poisoned arrows. Production. The film was based on an original story and script by Frances Marion. Producer Harry Edington had a deal at Universal and announced it for production in April 1939.

Otto Preminger was shown the galley proof of the 1,046-page Gilden manuscript by his brother Ingo and, fully expecting it to be another \"Gone with the Wind\", purchased the film rights to the novel for $100,000 eight months prior to its publication. He initially intended to adapt it for a four-and-a-half-hour epic film that would be shown twice-a-day at what would be the highest price scale in the history of American film exhibition, with a top admission of $25 on Friday and Saturday nights. When the book sold a mere 300,000 copies, Preminger decided a less grandiose project might be in order. Because he admired his screenplay for the Harper Lee novel \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", Preminger hired Horton Foote to adapt the Gilden book, which the author thought was \"embarrassing,\" with \"no genuine Southern flavor at all.\" His first instinct was to decline the offer, but he then decided he could do something with it, so Preminger installed him and his family in a house in London, where the director was filming \"Bunny Lake Is Missing\"."], "distances": [0.3556452989578247, 0.3556452989578247, 0.5320266485214233, 0.5320266485214233, 0.5747820138931274, 0.5747820138931274, 0.6108088493347168, 0.6108088493347168, 0.6312767267227173, 0.6323069334030151], "supports": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "metadatas": [{"pool_index": 5, "mapped_id": "0055e39a-cde5-4c17-85c4-4538a4bfb01f", "doc_name": "Tarzan and the Great River", "support": 1}, {"support": 1, "pool_index": 340, "mapped_id": "0055e39a-cde5-4c17-85c4-4538a4bfb01f", "doc_name": "Tarzan and the Great River"}, {"doc_name": "Tarzan River", "pool_index": 7, "mapped_id": "0055e39a-cde5-4c17-85c4-4538a4bfb01f", "support": 0}, {"mapped_id": "0055e39a-cde5-4c17-85c4-4538a4bfb01f", "support": 0, "doc_name": "Tarzan River", "pool_index": 342}, {"pool_index": 6, "mapped_id": "0055e39a-cde5-4c17-85c4-4538a4bfb01f", "doc_name": "Tarzan and the Great River", "support": 0}, {"mapped_id": "0055e39a-cde5-4c17-85c4-4538a4bfb01f", "doc_name": "Tarzan and the Great River", "support": 0, "pool_index": 341}, {"mapped_id": "0055e39a-cde5-4c17-85c4-4538a4bfb01f", "pool_index": 8, "doc_name": "Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins", "support": 0}, {"pool_index": 343, "support": 0, "mapped_id": "0055e39a-cde5-4c17-85c4-4538a4bfb01f", "doc_name": "Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins"}, {"support": 1, "doc_name": "Green Hell (film)", "pool_index": 545, "mapped_id": "0f9c4386-c0d0-48a9-a96c-e8f07ffeced7"}, {"mapped_id": "06b5b880-943b-4ac9-90a9-0679ca01506c", "pool_index": 677, "doc_name": "Hurry Sundown (film)", "support": 0}], "recall": 1.0, "precision": 0.3, "ndcg": 0.9066276098484507, "mrr": 1.0}

Endpoint Protection is the result of a merger of several security software products, including Symantec Antivirus Corporate Edition 10.0, Client Security, Network Access Control, and Sygate Enterprise Edition. Endpoint Protection also included new features. For example, it can block data transfers to unauthorized device types, such as USB flash drives or Bluetooth devices. At the time, Symantec Antivirus Corporate Edition was widely criticized as having become bloated and unwieldy. Endpoint Protection 11.0 was intended to address these criticisms. The disk footprint of Symantec Corporate Edition 10.0 was almost 100 MB, whereas Endpoint Protection's was projected to be 21 MB. In 2009, Symantec introduced a managed service, whereby Symantec staff deploy and manage Symantec Endpoint Protection installations remotely. A Small Business Edition with a faster installation process was released in 2010. In February 2011, Symantec announced version 12.0 of Endpoint Protection.

In practice. Mithridatism is not effective against all types of poison. Immunity is generally only possible with biologically complex types which the immune system can respond to. Depending on the toxin, the practice can lead to the lethal accumulation of a poison in the body. Results depend on how each poison is processed by the body, i.e. on how the toxic compound is metabolized or passed out of the body. However, in some cases, it is possible to build up a metabolic tolerance against specific non-biological poisons. This involves conditioning the liver to produce more of the particular enzymes that metabolize these poisons. For example, heavy drinkers develop a tolerance to the effects of alcohol. However, metabolic tolerance can also lead to accumulation of the less toxic metabolized compound which can slowly damage the liver. With alcohol this generally leads to conditions such as alcoholic fatty liver disease. Metabolic tolerance is not effective on all types of non-biological poisons.
