Joe doesn't mail the letter, but in fact hands it to Lamont personally, as Lamont is staying nearby to keep an eye on Tom, who is oblivious to Lamont's presence. Tom is deliberately pushed off the sidewalk and into traffic and almost killed by a speeding car, though he does not catch his attacker. He goes back to the lodge complex, and Sarah tells him that she doesn't have feelings for Buddy anymore. The next day, Tom attends dinner with all lodge guests, including dowager Kate Redwing whom Tom asks about Jeanine Thielman.

Unbeknownst to Tom, this person is Lamont himself. The next morning, upon returning from his walk, Barbara Deane tells him that Ralph Redwing's bodyguards came by under Buddy's orders to deliver a message to Tom: Stay away from Sarah.

In practice. Mithridatism is not effective against all types of poison. Immunity is generally only possible with biologically complex types which the immune system can respond to. Depending on the toxin, the practice can lead to the lethal accumulation of a poison in the body. Results depend on how each poison is processed by the body, i.e. on how the toxic compound is metabolized or passed out of the body. However, in some cases, it is possible to build up a metabolic tolerance against specific non-biological poisons. This involves conditioning the liver to produce more of the particular enzymes that metabolize these poisons. For example, heavy drinkers develop a tolerance to the effects of alcohol. However, metabolic tolerance can also lead to accumulation of the less toxic metabolized compound which can slowly damage the liver. With alcohol this generally leads to conditions such as alcoholic fatty liver disease. Metabolic tolerance is not effective on all types of non-biological poisons.

This process allows humans to ingest small amounts of cyanide in food like apple seeds and survive small amounts of cyanide gas from fires and cigarettes. However, one cannot effectively condition the liver against cyanide, unlike alcohol. Relatively larger amounts of cyanide are still highly lethal because, while the body can produce more rhodanese, the process also requires large amounts of sulfur-containing substrates.

Spells of erotic attraction and compulsion are found within the syncretic magic tradition of Hellenistic Greece, which incorporated Egyptian and Hebraic elements as documented in texts such as the Greek Magical Papyri and archaeologically on amulets and other artifacts dating from the 2nd century BC (and sometimes earlier) to the late 3rd century A.D. These magical practices continued to influence private rituals in Gaul among Celtic peoples, in Roman Britain, and among Germanic peoples. Christopher A. Faraone, a University of Chicago Classics professor specializing in texts and practices pertaining to magic, distinguishes between the magic of \"eros\", as practiced by men, and the magic of \"philia\", practiced by women. These two types of spells can be connected directly to the gender roles of men and women in Ancient Greece. Women used \"philia\" spells because they were more dependent on their husbands. In marriage, women were powerless as men were legally permitted to divorce. As a result, many used any means necessary to maintain their marriages which meant more interest in affection producing spells."], "distances": [0.91796875, 0.91796875, 0.6875, 0.6875, 0.68359375, 0.6484375, 0.6484375, 0.6015625, 0.6015625, 0.39453125], "supports": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "metadatas": [{"support": 1, "doc_name": "Mithridatism", "mapped_id": "0066d36e-f0e8-4cbb-a302-4c4d0b0498f2", "pool_index": 1250}, {"doc_name": "Mithridatism", "pool_index": 95, "mapped_id": "0066d36e-f0e8-4cbb-a302-4c4d0b0498f2", "support": 1}, {"mapped_id": "0066d36e-f0e8-4cbb-a302-4c4d0b0498f2", "pool_index": 1252, "doc_name": "Mithridatism", "support": 0}, {"mapped_id": "0066d36e-f0e8-4cbb-a302-4c4d0b0498f2", "pool_index": 97, "support": 0, "doc_name": "Mithridatism"}, {"doc_name": "Mithridatism", "mapped_id": "0066d36e-f0e8-4cbb-a302-4c4d0b0498f2", "support": 0, "pool_index": 98}, {"mapped_id": "0066d36e-f0e8-4cbb-a302-4c4d0b0498f2", "doc_name": "Mithridatism", "pool_index": 96, "support": 0}, {"support": 0, "pool_index": 1251, "mapped_id": "0066d36e-f0e8-4cbb-a302-4c4d0b0498f2", "doc_name": "Mithridatism"}, {"support": 0, "pool_index": 99, "doc_name": "Mithridatism", "mapped_id": "0066d36e-f0e8-4cbb-a302-4c4d0b0498f2"}, {"mapped_id": "0066d36e-f0e8-4cbb-a302-4c4d0b0498f2", "doc_name": "Mithridatism", "pool_index": 1254, "support": 0}, {"support": 0, "mapped_id": "0de02215-f275-4d6e-a034-1ff7a3b74a13", "pool_index": 162, "doc_name": "Love magic"}], "recall": 1.0, "precision": 0.2, "ndcg": 1.0, "mrr": 1.0}

The film draws on the story of the 1991 Telugu film \"Aditya 369\"; while the Telugu film deals with travel to the past as well as dystopian post-apocalyptic future, \"Love Story 2050\" is exclusively about travelling to a utopian future-city of Mumbai in the year 2050. It is Bollywood's first utopian time travel film. Some parts were filmed in Adelaide, South Australia. Kaurna educator, cultural adviser, and dancer Jack Buckskin performed in the film with Taikurtinna, an Aboriginal dance group. The special effects were executed by four international firms. Two special effects houses – Weta Workshop (New Zealand) and John Cox (Brisbane, Australia) – have won an Academy Award for their work on international projects. Along with Harman and Priyanka, a robot was seen playing a major role; viewers also get to see a teddy bear, which appears to be more than a toy. Priyanka Chopra played a dual role, for which, she had to color her hair twice, once red to portray the girl from the future and then black. The red-haired look was inspired from Baweja's sister, Rowena Baweja's painting, which portrayed women of today and tomorrow. The script of \"Love Story 2050\" inspired her to do the painting.
