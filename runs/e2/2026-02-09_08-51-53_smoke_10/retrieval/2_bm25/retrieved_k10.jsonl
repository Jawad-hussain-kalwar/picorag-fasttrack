Somerset Maugham thought that the short story \"must have a definite design, which includes a point of departure, a climax and a point of test; in other words, it must have a plot\". Hugh Walpole had a similar view: \"A story should be a story; a record of things happening full of incidents, swift movements, unexpected development, leading through suspense to a climax and a satisfying denouement.\" This view of the short story as a finished product of art is however opposed by Anton Chekhov, who thought that a story should have neither a beginning nor an end. It should just be a \"slice of life\", presented suggestively. In his stories, Chekhov does not round off the end but leaves it to the readers to draw their own conclusions. Sukumar Azhikode defined a short story as \"a brief prose narrative with an intense episodic or anecdotal effect\". Flannery O'Connor emphasized the need to consider what is exactly meant by the descriptor short. Short story writers may define their works as part of the artistic and personal expression of the form.

He was just in time; a drop of poison had already reached the baby and touched his head, leaving a permanent blueish spot (a \"bindu\") on his forehead. Thus, the newborn was named \"Bindusara\". In practice. Mithridatism is not effective against all types of poison. Immunity is generally only possible with biologically complex types which the immune system can respond to. Depending on the toxin, the practice can lead to the lethal accumulation of a poison in the body. Results depend on how each poison is processed by the body, i.e. on how the toxic compound is metabolized or passed out of the body. However, in some cases, it is possible to build up a metabolic tolerance against specific non-biological poisons. This involves conditioning the liver to produce more of the particular enzymes that metabolize these poisons. For example, heavy drinkers develop a tolerance to the effects of alcohol. However, metabolic tolerance can also lead to accumulation of the less toxic metabolized compound which can slowly damage the liver. With alcohol this generally leads to conditions such as alcoholic fatty liver disease. Metabolic tolerance is not effective on all types of non-biological poisons. Exposure to certain toxic substances, such as hydrofluoric acid and heavy metals, is either lethal or has little to no effect. A minor exception is cyanide, which can be metabolized by the liver.", "The group also returned to jazz and R&amp;B themes on their albums: their first, 1964's \"The Five Faces of Manfred Mann\", included standards such as \"Smokestack Lightning\" while the second and last with this line-up, \"Mann Made\", offered several self-composed instrumentals and a version of \"Stormy Monday Blues\" alongside novelties and pop ballads.

In September 2018, Mark Saltzman, one of the script and songwriters for \"Sesame Street\", stated in an interview with \"Queerty\" that when he wrote Bert and Ernie, they were often analogues for his own intimate relationship with film editor Arnold Glassman. Sesame Workshop responded by stating that Bert and Ernie have no sexual orientations, because they are puppets.

Why the need to define people as only gay? There's much more to a human being than just straightness or gayness. The Gay Star News reported that fans reacted negatively to Sesame Workshop's statement. Frank Oz later tweeted in September 2018:\nA last thought: If Jim and I had created Bert and Ernie as gay characters they would be inauthentic, coming from two straight men.

A 12th ship, the French frigate \"Le Grifon\", had sailed with the fleet. Its captain was unfamiliar with the Florida coastline and elected to stay further out to sea. The \"Grifon\" safely returned to Europe. Because the fleet was carrying silver, it is also known as the 1715 Plate Fleet (\"plata\" being the Spanish word for silver). Some artifacts and even coins still wash up on Florida beaches from time to time. According to Cuban records, around 1,500 sailors perished while a small number survived in lifeboats.

According to popular conception, these people often buried their stolen fortunes in remote places, intending to return to them later (often with the use of a pirate’s treasure map). Pirates burying treasure was a rare occurrence, with the only known instance being William Kidd, who buried some of his wealth on Gardiners Island. The myth of buried pirate treasure was popularized by such 19th-century fiction as \"Wolfert Webber\", \"The Gold-Bug\", and \"Treasure Island\". The idea of treasure maps leading to buried treasure is considered a fictional device. There are cases of buried treasure from different historical periods, such as the Dacian king Decebalus and Visigoth king Alaric I, who both changed the course of rivers to hide their treasures. Legends of buried pirate treasure have existed for centuries, but authenticated discoveries are rare. For example, extensive excavations on Oak Island, Nova Scotia have not yielded any treasure. The only authenticated treasure chest in the United States is kept at the Pirate Soul Museum in St. Augustine, Florida. Buried treasure is a cultural concept and not the same as a hoard, which is typically found by archaeologists and metal detectors. The Fenn treasure, reportedly buried by millionaire Forrest Fenn in 2010, was found in 2020 in Wyoming. Pirates. Pirates burying treasure was rare.", "The main character, Edward Kenway, is aboard one of the ships in the fleet as a prisoner, and manages to escape with the help of his future quartermaster, Adéwalé, recruiting other captive pirates as a crew.

Paine conducted a survey of all known or purported stories of buried treasure and published them in \"The Book of Buried Treasure\". He found a common trait in all the stories: there was always a lone survivor of a piratical crew who somehow preserved a chart showing where the treasure was buried, but unable to return himself, he transfers the map or information to a friend or shipmate, usually on his deathbed. This person would then go search in vain for the treasure, but not before transferring the legend down to another hapless seeker. Cases. The Roman historian Dio Cassius says that, in the early 2nd century, the Dacian king Decebalus had changed the course of the river Sargetia and buried tons of gold and silver in the riverbed. Later, he ordered the river to be restored, and the slaves involved in the works to be executed. However, one of his nobles revealed the treasure's location to the Romans. The Byzantine historian Jordanes tells a similar story of the burial of the Visigoth king Alaric I and his treasure under the river Busento in 410. The burial places of the Khazar kings (\"qoruq\") and other inner Asian people were also under a rerouted river. There are a number of reports of supposed buried pirate treasure that surfaced much earlier than these works, indicating that the idea was around for more than a century before those stories were published.", "The only pirate known to have actually buried treasure was William Kidd, who is believed to have buried at least some of his wealth on Gardiners Island near Long Island before sailing into New York City. Kidd had originally been commissioned as a privateer for England, but his behavior had strayed into outright piracy, and he hoped that his treasure could serve as a bargaining chip in negotiations to avoid punishment. His bid was unsuccessful, however, and Kidd was hanged as a pirate. In English fiction, there are three well-known stories that helped to popularize the myth of buried pirate treasure: \"Wolfert Webber\" (1824) by Washington Irving, \"The Gold-Bug\" (1843) by Edgar Allan Poe and \"Treasure Island\" (1883) by Robert Louis Stevenson. These stories differ widely in plot and literary treatment but are all based on the William Kidd legend. David Cordingly states that \"The effect of \"Treasure Island\" on our perception of pirates cannot be overestimated,\" and says the idea of treasure maps leading to buried treasure \"is an entirely fictional device\". Stevenson's \"Treasure Island\" was directly influenced by Irving's \"Wolfert Webber,\" Stevenson saying in his preface, \"It is my debt to Washington Irving that exercises my conscience, and justly so, for I believe plagiarism was rarely carried farther... the whole inner spirit and a good deal of the material detail of my first chapters... were the property of Washington Irving.\"", "Although the two songs have nothing else in common, the popularity of Prima's combination, further popularized by David Lee Roth on his 1985 EP \"Crazy From The Heat\", has led to the mistaken perception by some that the songs are two parts of a single original composition.

On 2 May 1769, at El Rincón, near Riohacha, they set their village afire, burning the church and two Spaniards who had taken refuge in it. They also captured the priest.

The early ballads are also quite clear on Robin Hood's social status: he is a yeoman. While the precise meaning of this term changed over time, including free retainers of an aristocrat and small landholders, it always referred to commoners. The essence of it in the present context was \"neither a knight nor a peasant or 'husbonde' but something in between\". Artisans (such as millers) were among those regarded as 'yeomen' in the 14th century. From the 16th century on, there were attempts to elevate Robin Hood to the nobility, such as in Richard Grafton's \"Chronicle at Large\"; Anthony Munday presented him at the very end of the century as the Earl of Huntingdon in two extremely influential plays, as he is still commonly presented in modern times. As well as ballads, the legend was also transmitted by 'Robin Hood games' or plays that were an important part of the late medieval and early modern May Day festivities. The first record of a Robin Hood game was in 1426 in Exeter, but the reference does not indicate how old or widespread this custom was at the time. The Robin Hood games are known to have flourished in the later 15th and 16th centuries.

In this respect, James Light, in his book \"Violence, Dreams, and Dostoevsky: The Art of Nathanael West\", suggests that \"The Day of the Locust\" falls in with a motif in West's fiction; the exposure of hopeful narratives in modern American culture as frauds. As some critics point out, West's novel was a radical challenge to modernist literature. Some modernists set themselves up in opposition to mass culture; West depicts it and makes it an integral part of the novel.

The novel details Tod's observation of the filming of the Battle of Waterloo. His goal is to find inspiration for the painting he is getting ready to begin, a work titled \"The Burning of Los Angeles.\" Tod falls in love with Faye Greener, an aspiring starlet who lives nearby but Faye only loves men who are good looking or wealthy. She is beautiful but lacks the acting talent to progress beyond roles as an extra. Tod is simply a \"good-hearted man,\" the kind Faye likes.

These were brought together in November 1963 under the title of \"Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins\" in the first complete edition. Despite the gap in when they were written and first published, the events of the two stories occur in the same time-frame. The opening passage of \"Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins, with Jad-bal-ja, the Golden Lion\" specifies that its events occur immediately after those of \"The Tarzan Twins.\" In relation to other Tarzan stories, the two parts of the Tarzan Twins tale presumably fall between \"Tarzan and the Ant Men\" and \"Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle\" chronologically, as the initial part was published between these two novels. The second part confirms their placement in approximately this period, as it introduces a family that figures prominently in \"Tarzan and the Lost Empire\", the next book after \"Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle\"; specifically, it features Tarzan's first meeting with Doctor Karl von Harben, with whom he is already acquainted in \"Empire\".

This person would then go search in vain for the treasure, but not before transferring the legend down to another hapless seeker. Cases. The Roman historian Dio Cassius says that, in the early 2nd century, the Dacian king Decebalus had changed the course of the river Sargetia and buried tons of gold and silver in the riverbed. Later, he ordered the river to be restored, and the slaves involved in the works to be executed. However, one of his nobles revealed the treasure's location to the Romans. The Byzantine historian Jordanes tells a similar story of the burial of the Visigoth king Alaric I and his treasure under the river Busento in 410. The burial places of the Khazar kings (\"qoruq\") and other inner Asian people were also under a rerouted river. There are a number of reports of supposed buried pirate treasure that surfaced much earlier than these works, indicating that the idea was around for more than a century before those stories were published.", "Thus \"Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle\" is generally considered the eleventh Tarzan book rather than \"Twins\".

According to ITIL, SAM is defined as “…all of the infrastructure and processes necessary for the effective management, control, and protection of the software assets…throughout all stages of their lifecycle.” \nFundamentally intended to be part of an organization's information technology business strategy, the goals of SAM are to reduce information technology (IT) costs and limit business and legal risk related to the ownership and use of software, while maximizing IT responsiveness and end-user productivity. SAM is particularly important for large corporations regarding redistribution of licenses and managing legal risks associated with software ownership and expiration. SAM technologies track license expiration, thus allowing the company to function ethically and within software compliance regulations. This can be important for both eliminating legal costs associated with license agreement violations and as part of a company's reputation management strategy. Both are important forms of risk management and are critical for large corporations' long-term business strategies. SAM is one facet of a broader business discipline known as IT asset management, which includes overseeing both software and hardware that comprise an organization's computers and network. Role within organizations. SAM can serve many different functions within organizations, depending on their software portfolios, IT infrastructures, resource availability, and business goals. For many organizations, the goal of implementing a SAM program is very tactical, explicitly focused on balancing the number of software licenses purchased with the number of actual licenses consumed or used.", "In addition to balancing the number of licenses purchased with the amount of consumption, an effective SAM program must also ensure that the usage of all installed software is in keeping with the terms and conditions of the specific vendor license agreement. In doing so, organizations can minimize liabilities associated with software piracy in the event of an audit by a software vendor or a third party such as the Business Software Alliance (BSA). SAM, according to this interpretation, involves conducting detailed software inventories on an ongoing basis to determine the exact number of software licenses consumed, comparing this information with the number of licenses purchased, and reviewing how the software is being used in respect to the terms and conditions and establishing controls to ensure that proper licensing practices are maintained on an ongoing basis. This can be accomplished through IT processes, purchasing policies and procedures, and technology solutions such as software inventory tools. Counting installations are the most common means of measuring license consumption but some software is licensed by the number of users, capital, processors, or CPU Cores. More broadly defined, the strategic goals of SAM often include (but are not limited to) the following: \nSAM Technology. Several technologies are available to support key SAM processes:\nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO). The ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards are designed to help organizations manage IT assets including software assets (SAM). The published standards are outlined below:\nISO/IEC 19770-1:2017: IT Asset Management Systems Requirements is a process framework to enable an organization to incorporate ITAM (including SAM) processes and policies sufficient to satisfy corporate governance requirements and ensure effective support for IT service management overall.", "The implementation of SAM processes to be \"accomplished in multiple staged increments or tiers.\" Part 1 of the standard details SAM processes including control environment, planning and implementation, inventory, verification and compliance, operations management and life cycle.

The current version was published in 2015 and is a revision to the 2009 original Software ID Tag standard. Using software identification tags or SWID tags makes discovery a simpler and more accurate process that can be verified by software vendors if they audit an organisations entire estate. SWID tags are implemented and supported by many vendors including IBM, Microsoft and Adobe. ISO/IEC 19770-3:2016: Entitlement Management Schema outlines a technical schema which can be used to encapsulate license details including contract information, entitlements, rights, limitations and details about invoice, PO numbers, etc. ISO/IEC 19770-4:2017: Resource Utilization Measurement provides an ITAM data standard for Resource Utilization Measurement (\"RUM\").

The film was released in theaters on April 17, 2015, and through video on demand on April 22, 2015. Plot. Exactly 100 years after the Armenian genocide committed within the Ottoman Empire, a director (Simon Abkarian) is staging a play at the historic Los Angeles Theatre to honor the victims of the massacre. The play stars his enigmatic wife (Angela Sarafyan) as an Armenian woman in 1915 who must make a tragic and controversial decision that will change the course of history. This will not be an ordinary performance. As protesters surround the theater before showtime, and a series of strange accidents spread panic among its actors (Sam Page, Nikolai Kinski) and producer (Jim Piddock), it appears that Simon's mission is far more dangerous than we think—and the ghosts of the past are everywhere. Themes. The film explores many themes, especially that of denial—referring not only to the 100-year denial of the Armenian Genocide by the Republic of Turkey, but also the many forms of individual denial among the characters in the story."], "distances": [29.223317157475698, 24.60042185636114, 19.400728907711695, 18.360558965410167, 11.021680964168567, 5.666433210636679, 5.593403083463053, 5.371908599671649, 4.937510132344157, 4.87753775261242], "supports": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], "metadatas": [{"mapped_id": "00577db7-7b43-4364-b29e-ff4cb606c8ed", "doc_name": "Software asset management", "support": 1, "pool_index": 100}, {"mapped_id": "00577db7-7b43-4364-b29e-ff4cb606c8ed", "doc_name": "Software asset management", "support": 0, "pool_index": 101}, {"mapped_id": "00577db7-7b43-4364-b29e-ff4cb606c8ed", "doc_name": "Software asset management", "support": 0, "pool_index": 102}, {"mapped_id": "00577db7-7b43-4364-b29e-ff4cb606c8ed", "doc_name": "VITAL (asset management software)", "support": 0, "pool_index": 104}, {"mapped_id": "00577db7-7b43-4364-b29e-ff4cb606c8ed", "doc_name": "Software asset management", "support": 0, "pool_index": 103}, {"mapped_id": "00bfd1eb-be2d-452a-bfff-7366b34221e1", "doc_name": "Show Me Love (t.A.T.u. song)", "support": 0, "pool_index": 184}, {"mapped_id": "00acbdb7-0afa-4f62-81b7-a95e501336a4", "doc_name": "The Day of the Locust", "support": 1, "pool_index": 191}, {"mapped_id": "0189c0a8-88a8-4785-a639-b0904cde3f2f", "doc_name": "Short story", "support": 0, "pool_index": 68}, {"mapped_id": "0055e39a-cde5-4c17-85c4-4538a4bfb01f", "doc_name": "Tarzan and the Great River", "support": 1, "pool_index": 5}, {"mapped_id": "0085a069-c8c1-4a78-9074-0f17d2073f9c", "doc_name": "1915 (film)", "support": 0, "pool_index": 16}], "recall": 1.0, "precision": 0.3, "ndcg": 0.7669719408901708, "mrr": 1.0}
{"query_id": "0066d36e-f0e8-4cbb-a302-4c4d0b0498f2", "documents": ["Self-dosing with poison to gain immunity\nMithridatism is the practice of protecting oneself against a poison by gradually self-administering non-lethal amounts. The word is derived from Mithridates VI, the king of Pontus, who so feared being poisoned that he regularly ingested small doses, aiming to develop immunity. Background. Mithridates VI's father, Mithridates V, was assassinated by poisoning by a conspiracy among his attendants. After this, Mithridates VI's mother held regency over Pontus (a Hellenistic kingdom, 281 BC–62 AD) until a male heir came of age. Mithridates was in competition with his brother for the throne and his mother began to favor his brother. Supposedly, during his youth, he began to suspect plots against him at his own mother's orders and was aware of her possible connection with his father's death. He then began to notice pains in his stomach during his meals and suspected his mother had ordered small amounts of poison to be added to his food to slowly kill him off. With other assassination attempts, he fled into the wild. While in the wild, it is said that he began ingesting non-lethal amounts of poisons and mixing many into a universal remedy to make him immune to all known poisons. After Mithridates' death, many Roman physicians claimed to possess and improve the formula. In keeping with most medical practices of his era, Mithridates' anti-poison routines included a religious component, supervised by the \"Agari\", a group of Scythian shamans who never left him.", "It has been suggested that Russian mystic Rasputin's survival of a poisoning attempt was due to mithridatism, but this has not been proven. Indian epics talk about this practice as well. It has been said that, during the rule of the king Chandragupta Maurya (320–298 BC), there was a practice of selecting beautiful girls and administering poison in small amounts until they grew up, thus making them insensitive to poison. These maidens were called \"vishakanyas\" (visha 'poison' + kanya 'maiden'). It was believed that making love with vishakanyas could result in the death of their partners, hence they were employed to kill enemies. The emperor Bindusara was the son of the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya and his queen Durdhara. According to the \"Rajavalikatha\", a Jain work, the original name of this emperor was Simhasena. A legend mentioned in the Jain texts tells the story of how Chandragupta's Guru and advisor Chanakya used to feed the emperor with small doses of poison to build his immunity against possible poisoning attempts by his enemies. One day, Chandragupta, unaware that his food contained poison, shared his food with his pregnant wife, Queen Durdhara, who was seven days away from delivery. The queen, who was not immune to the poison, collapsed and died within a few minutes.", "Chanakya entered the room at the moment she collapsed, and in order to save the child in the womb, he immediately cut open the dead queen's belly and took the baby out. He was just in time; a drop of poison had already reached the baby and touched his head, leaving a permanent blueish spot (a \"bindu\") on his forehead. Thus, the newborn was named \"Bindusara\". In practice. Mithridatism is not effective against all types of poison. Immunity is generally only possible with biologically complex types which the immune system can respond to. Depending on the toxin, the practice can lead to the lethal accumulation of a poison in the body. Results depend on how each poison is processed by the body, i.e. on how the toxic compound is metabolized or passed out of the body. However, in some cases, it is possible to build up a metabolic tolerance against specific non-biological poisons. This involves conditioning the liver to produce more of the particular enzymes that metabolize these poisons. For example, heavy drinkers develop a tolerance to the effects of alcohol. However, metabolic tolerance can also lead to accumulation of the less toxic metabolized compound which can slowly damage the liver. With alcohol this generally leads to conditions such as alcoholic fatty liver disease. Metabolic tolerance is not effective on all types of non-biological poisons. Exposure to certain toxic substances, such as hydrofluoric acid and heavy metals, is either lethal or has little to no effect. A minor exception is cyanide, which can be metabolized by the liver.", "Brief work of literature, usually written in narrative prose\nA short story is a piece of prose fiction. It can typically be read in a single sitting and focuses on a self-contained incident or series of linked incidents, with the intent of evoking a single effect or mood. The short story is one of the oldest types of literature and has existed in the form of legends, mythic tales, folk tales, fairy tales, tall tales, fables, and anecdotes in various ancient communities around the world. The modern short story developed in the early 19th century. Definition. The short story is a crafted form in its own right. Short stories make use of plot, resonance and other dynamic components as in a novel, but typically to a lesser degree. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel or novella/short novel, authors generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. The short story is sometimes referred to as a genre. Determining what exactly defines a short story remains problematic. A classic definition of a short story is that one should be able to read it in one sitting, a point most notably made in Edgar Allan Poe's essay \"The Philosophy of Composition\" (1846). H. G. Wells described the purpose of the short story as \"The jolly art, of making something very bright and moving; it may be horrible or pathetic or funny or profoundly illuminating, having only this essential, that it should take from fifteen to fifty minutes to read aloud.\"", "Venus Hum is an electronic pop music group from Nashville, Tennessee, consisting of vocalist Annette Strean and multi-instrumentalists Kip Kubin and Tony Miracle. Miracle has a rare heart condition which results in perpetually hearing his own heartbeat in his ears. This condition is known as \"venous hum\", from which the group's name is derived. Their first full-length album, titled \"Venus Hum\", was released in 2001. \"Big Beautiful Sky\" was released two years later. Also in 2003, Venus Hum toured with and opened for Blue Man Group, with Strean providing vocals on \"I Feel Love\". After their collaboration with J. J. Abrams (\"Alias\", \"Lost\", \"\"), and their subsequent creation of the EP \"Songs for Superheroes\", it was uncertain whether Venus Hum would release any new material. Strean had developed painful vocal fold nodules and needed a speech pathologist to relearn her singing ability. Kip diversified, furthering his interest in filmmaking, becoming a director of music videos, electronic press kits and special features. Tony traveled, living in Los Angeles and Cincinnati and releasing an experimental solo album under the moniker \"Satellite City\". After a two-year hiatus, the group reorganized and released a new album, \"The Colors in the Wheel\" on July 25, 2006, under the Mono-Fi Records label, which they described as \"unconventional, three-dimensional and completely five-sensual\" featuring an edgier sound than their previous work.", "Dr. Rand Brandes tells the story of the title \"Field Work\" in \"The Cambridge Companion to Seamus Heaney\". Heaney originally wanted to name the work “Polder.” His editor, Charles Monteith, insisted that Heaney change the title because readers may not be able to pronounce the word. Heaney then wanted the title “Easter Water,” but this name was also discarded in favor of the final name: \"Field Work\". Heaney said of the final title: \"I gave \"Field Work\" that title partly because there’s an element of samplings in it. But I think there’s an opener note in it as well. What holds \"Field Work\" together—this is only my view of it—is a certain ease of the voice.\" Heaney also provided his own explanation of how all his titles came about: “What usually happens is that I start to look for one [a title] once a ‘critical mass’ of poems gets written. I find that if I have a working title at that stage – say when half a volume is in existence – the title itself can help in shaping, or at least inclining and suggesting, the poems to come.”\nReception. In a review for \"The New York Times\", O’Donoghue called \"Field Work\": “a superb book, the most eloquent and far-reaching book he has written, a perennial poetry offered at a time when many of us have despaired of seeing such a thing.\"", "According to one version of the legend, the oil had then passed to Henry's maternal grandfather, Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Evidence of Henry's deliberate connexion to St Thomas lies in the structure of the tomb itself. The wooden panel at the western end of his tomb bears a painting of the martyrdom of Becket, and the tester, or wooden canopy, above the tomb is painted with Henry's personal motto, 'Soverayne', alternated by crowned golden eagles. Likewise, the three large coats of arms that dominate the tester painting are surrounded by collars of SS, a golden eagle enclosed in each tiret. The presence of such eagle motifs most likely points directly to Henry's coronation oil and his ideological association with St Thomas. Sometime after the King's death, an imposing tomb was built for him and his queen, probably commissioned and paid for by Queen Joan herself. On top of the tomb chest lie detailed alabaster effigies of the King and Queen, crowned and dressed in their ceremonial robes. Henry's body was evidently well-embalmed, as an exhumation in 1832 established, allowing historians to state with reasonable certainty that the effigies are accurate portrait. The Corona Tower. The Corona Tower (sometimes known as \"Beckets's Crown\"), a circular structure at the east end of the Trinity chapel, is widely thought to have received its name from having been built to contain the relic of the crown of St. Thomas's head which was struck off during his murder.", "They are what Light calls \"grotesques\".

Tod Hackett is the novel's protagonist. He moves from the East coast to Hollywood, California in search of inspiration for his next painting. The novel is set in the 1930s during the Great Depression. Most of the characters exist at the fringes of the Hollywood film industry, but Hollywood is merely the backdrop for Tod Hackett's revelation. Tod is employed by a Hollywood studio \"to learn set and costume designing.\" During his spare time, Tod sketches scenes he observes on large production sets and studio back lots.

His goal is to find inspiration for the painting he is getting ready to begin, a work titled \"The Burning of Los Angeles.\" Tod falls in love with Faye Greener, an aspiring starlet who lives nearby but Faye only loves men who are good looking or wealthy. She is beautiful but lacks the acting talent to progress beyond roles as an extra. Tod is simply a \"good-hearted man,\" the kind Faye likes.

Tod wants to \"throw himself [at her], no matter what the cost.\" Throughout the novel, Tod fantasizes about having a sexual encounter with Faye as an act of rape.", "East end of Canterbury Cathedral\nTrinity Chapel at the east end of Canterbury Cathedral forms part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was built under the supervision of the master-masons William of Sens and William the Englishman as a shrine for the relics of St. Thomas Becket. The shrine became one of the most popular pilgrimage sites in England. Origin. The chapel was constructed between 1179 and 1184, replacing a much smaller chapel of the same name destroyed by fire, along with much of the rest of the choir, in 1174. Its predecessor was where Becket celebrated his first mass following his installation as Archbishop of Canterbury. Thomas Becket. In 1220, Becket's remains were translated from his first tomb to the finished chapel. As a result of this event, the chapel became a major pilgrimage site, inspiring Geoffrey Chaucer to write \"The Canterbury Tales\" in 1387 and with routes (e.g. from Southwark (Chaucer's route) and the Pilgrim's Way to/from Winchester) converging on the cathedral. Becket's shrine stood until it was destroyed in 1540. This was done on orders from King Henry VIII as vengeance for his ancestor, Henry II. The king also destroyed Becket's bones and ordered that all mention of his name be obliterated. The pavement where the shrine stood in the chapel is today marked by a lighted candle. Modern day archbishops of Canterbury celebrate the Eucharist at this place to commemorate Becket's martyrdom and the translation of his body from his first burial place to this chapel.

Tradition has it that Coroebus, a cook from the city of Elis, was the first Olympic champion, which indicates that the competition was not limited to the aristocracy. The Olympics were of fundamental religious importance, and the sporting events, which were held alongside ritual sacrifices honouring both Zeus (whose famous statue by Phidias stood in his temple at Olympia) and Pelops (divine hero and mythical king of Olympia), did not start until the festival's second day. (Pelops was famous for his chariot race with King Oenomaus of Pisatis.) The winners of the events were admired and immortalised in poems and statues. Although a wreath made from the sacred olive tree in the precinct of Zeus was the only official prize at the Olympic Games, winners' fame brought them economic wealth, too, in the form of subsidies from their hometowns and wealthy sponsors."], "distances": [34.02348353575931, 26.480522344818016, 23.032471696477526, 22.481549013857006, 21.9022390848828, 21.772849440998797, 21.754233741727866, 21.6696343224383, 21.585132795034138, 21.094715035371095], "supports": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], "metadatas": [{"mapped_id": "0066d36e-f0e8-4cbb-a302-4c4d0b0498f2", "doc_name": "Mithridatism", "support": 1, "pool_index": 95}, {"mapped_id": "0066d36e-f0e8-4cbb-a302-4c4d0b0498f2", "doc_name": "Mithridatism", "support": 0, "pool_index": 96}, {"mapped_id": "0066d36e-f0e8-4cbb-a302-4c4d0b0498f2", "doc_name": "Mithridatism", "support": 0, "pool_index": 97}, {"mapped_id": "0189c0a8-88a8-4785-a639-b0904cde3f2f", "doc_name": "Short story", "support": 0, "pool_index": 67}, {"mapped_id": "0078f48f-b72d-4b72-b386-cc4086c9e9ee", "doc_name": "Venus Hum", "support": 1, "pool_index": 245}, {"mapped_id": "00eadf15-98f9-482d-b421-af2e5c7bc273", "doc_name": "Field Work (poetry collection)", "support": 1, "pool_index": 71}, {"mapped_id": "0153cd9c-7536-4ed5-9f1f-0dbf8472a40d", "doc_name": "Trinity Chapel", "support": 0, "pool_index": 227}, {"mapped_id": "00acbdb7-0afa-4f62-81b7-a95e501336a4", "doc_name": "The Day of the Locust", "support": 1, "pool_index": 191}, {"mapped_id": "0153cd9c-7536-4ed5-9f1f-0dbf8472a40d", "doc_name": "Trinity Chapel", "support": 1, "pool_index": 225}, {"mapped_id": "00e02ea6-9cca-4c59-9425-b2454cb95776", "doc_name": "Olympic Games", "support": 0, "pool_index": 139}], "recall": 1.0, "precision": 0.5, "ndcg": 0.8002671129756275, "mrr": 1.0}
