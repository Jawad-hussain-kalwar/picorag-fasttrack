According to ITIL, SAM is defined as \"all of the infrastructure and processes necessary for the effective management, control, and protection of the software assets throughout all stages of their lifecycle.\"\n\nFundamentally, SAM is intended as part of an organization's information technology (IT) business strategy. The goals of SAM are to reduce IT costs, limit business and legal risk related to the ownership and use of software, while maximizing IT responsiveness and end-user productivity. SAM is particularly important for large corporations regarding redistribution of licenses and managing legal risks associated with software ownership and expiration. SAM technologies track license expiration, allowing the company to function ethically and within software compliance regulations. This can be important for eliminating legal costs associated with license agreement violations and as part of a company's reputation management strategy. Both are important forms of risk management and are critical for large corporations' long-term business strategies. SAM is one facet of a broader business discipline known as IT asset management, which includes overseeing both software and hardware that comprise an organization's computers and network.\n\nRole within organizations. SAM can serve many different functions within organizations, depending on their software portfolios, IT infrastructures, resource availability, and business goals.
