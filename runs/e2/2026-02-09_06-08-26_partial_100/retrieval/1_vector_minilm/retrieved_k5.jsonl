According to popular conception, these people often buried their stolen fortunes in remote places, intending to return to them later (often with the use of a pirate’s treasure map). Pirates burying treasure was a rare occurrence, with the only known instance being William Kidd, who buried some of his wealth on Gardiners Island. The myth of buried pirate treasure was popularized by such 19th-century fiction as \"Wolfert Webber\", \"The Gold-Bug\", and \"Treasure Island\". The idea of treasure maps leading to buried treasure is considered a fictional device. There are cases of buried treasure from different historical periods, such as the Dacian king Decebalus and Visigoth king Alaric I, who both changed the course of rivers to hide their treasures. Legends of buried pirate treasure have existed for centuries, but authenticated discoveries are rare. For example, extensive excavations on Oak Island, Nova Scotia have not yielded any treasure. The only authenticated treasure chest in the United States is kept at the Pirate Soul Museum in St. Augustine, Florida.

The early ballads are also quite clear on Robin Hood's social status: he is a yeoman. While the precise meaning of this term changed over time, including free retainers of an aristocrat and small landholders, it always referred to commoners. The essence of it in the present context was \"neither a knight nor a peasant or 'husbonde' but something in between\". Artisans (such as millers) were among those regarded as 'yeomen' in the 14th century. From the 16th century on, there were attempts to elevate Robin Hood to the nobility, such as in Richard Grafton's \"Chronicle at Large\"; Anthony Munday presented him at the very end of the century as the Earl of Huntingdon in two extremely influential plays, as he is still commonly presented in modern times. As well as ballads, the legend was also transmitted by 'Robin Hood games' or plays that were an important part of the late medieval and early modern May Day festivities. The first record of a Robin Hood game was in 1426 in Exeter, but the reference does not indicate how old or widespread this custom was at the time.

GM's new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform, which was set to debut in the Cadillac CTS, was offered to Holden's engineers, but they believed that it was unsuitable for the car's requirements. The shoulder width in the rear seat was too narrow. Holden chose to develop a new platform, the GM Zeta, which would also serve as the basis for several upcoming GM vehicles.

Auden, who declared (in one of the interludes in \"The Dyer's Hand\") that West's novels were essentially \"parables about a Kingdom of Hell whose ruler is not so much a Father of Lies as a Father of Wishes\". In this respect, James Light, in his book \"Violence, Dreams, and Dostoevsky: The Art of Nathanael West\", suggests that \"The Day of the Locust\" falls in with a motif in West's fiction; the exposure of hopeful narratives in modern American culture as frauds. As some critics point out, West's novel was a radical challenge to modernist literature. Some modernists set themselves up in opposition to mass culture; West depicts it and makes it an integral part of the novel. West's use of grotesque imagery and situations establishes the novel as a work of Juvenalian satire."], "distances": [0.5436936616897583, 0.5436936616897583, 0.5645463466644287, 0.5645463466644287, 0.5966306328773499], "supports": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0], "metadatas": [{"mapped_id": "00acbdb7-0afa-4f62-81b7-a95e501336a4", "support": 0, "doc_name": "The Day of the Locust", "pool_index": 190}, {"support": 0, "doc_name": "The Day of the Locust", "mapped_id": "00acbdb7-0afa-4f62-81b7-a95e501336a4", "pool_index": 2020}, {"mapped_id": "00acbdb7-0afa-4f62-81b7-a95e501336a4", "doc_name": "The Day of the Locust", "support": 1, "pool_index": 191}, {"doc_name": "The Day of the Locust", "support": 1, "mapped_id": "00acbdb7-0afa-4f62-81b7-a95e501336a4", "pool_index": 2021}, {"doc_name": "The Day of the Locust", "pool_index": 193, "mapped_id": "00acbdb7-0afa-4f62-81b7-a95e501336a4", "support": 0}], "recall": 1.0, "precision": 0.4, "ndcg": 0.5706417189553201, "mrr": 0.3333333333333333}

Written in May 1947, \"No Connection\" was Asimov's first non-Foundation, non-robot series story in more than two years. John W. Campbell of \"Astounding Science Fiction\" purchased it that month. Plot summary. In the Earth of the far distant future, humans have died out and have been replaced, at least in the Americas, by a race descended from bears. Known to themselves as \"Gurrow sapiens\", they live peaceably in communal groupings, trading with each other and sharing communal property, monetary units and duties.

Kirkus Reviews gave a positive review, describing the book as being made with \"gusto and panache\" and called it \"a triumph\". Publishers Weekly likewise gave a positive review, describing the book as \"welcome addition to [Singer]'s oeuvre\". Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, writing for the New York Times, gave a mixed review, writing \"In the end you follow David Bendinger's adventures only halfway engaged...a certain detachment in Singer's prose always keeps you at arm's length.\" References. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;", "No Earthly Connection is a studio album by English keyboardist Rick Wakeman, released in April 1976 on A&amp;M Records.

This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce. This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars. The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were traveling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus. See also Finley and Pleket. The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend; one of the most popular myths identifies Heracles and his father Zeus as the progenitors of the Games. According to legend, it was Heracles who first called the Games \"Olympic\" and established the custom of holding them every four years. The myth continues that after Heracles completed his twelve labours, he built the Olympic Stadium as an honour to Zeus. Following its completion, he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a \"stadion\" (, Latin: , \"stage\"), which later became a unit of distance.

He was the first character created by the studio to draw audiences based on his star power, and the animators created many critically acclaimed shorts featuring the character. Even after he was supplanted by later characters, Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and, more importantly, the Warners directors, who recast him in numerous everyman and sidekick roles. He is known for his signature line at the end of many shorts, \"(stutter) that's all, folks!\" This slogan (without stuttering) had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of Looney Tunes cartoons. Porky is the oldest continuing Looney Tunes character. Porky's most distinctive trait is a severe stutter, for which he sometimes compensates by replacing his words; for example, \"What's going on?\" might become \"What's guh-guh-guh-guh—...what's happening?\" Porky's age varied widely in the series; originally conceived as an innocent seven-year-old piglet (explicitly mentioned as such in \"Porky's Preview\"), Porky was more frequently cast as an adult, often being cast as the competent straight man in the series in later years.", "The directors realized they had a star on their hands. Porky shared his stutter with the voice actor who originally played him, Joe Dougherty, who was actually a person who stuttered. Because Dougherty could not control his stutter, however, production costs became too high as his recording sessions took hours, and Porky's additional lines were done by Count Cutelli. Mel Blanc replaced Dougherty in 1937. Blanc continued the stutter; however, it was harnessed for a more precise comedic effect (such as stumbling over a simple word only to substitute a longer word without difficulty, or vice versa). This is parodied in \"A Connecticut Rabbit in King Arthur's Court\", where Bugs Bunny struggles to pronounce the word \"porcupine\", which Porky pronounces with no trouble. \"Porky's Duck Hunt\" was released in 1937, and Blanc officially became the permanent voice of Porky until his death in 1989. In later interviews, Blanc often said that he intended Porky's stutter to be suggestive of the grunting of actual pigs. \"Porky's Duck Hunt\" was also the first film of another Looney Tunes star, Daffy Duck. Porky Pig is currently voiced by Bob Bergen. Clampett's Porky. Porky starred in dozens of films in the late 1930s.

Background. JP Miller found his title in the 1896 poem \"Vitae Summa Brevis Spem Nos Vetat Incohare Longam\" by the English writer Ernest Dowson (1867–1900): It also inspired the title song devised by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer. They are not long, the weeping and the laughter,\nLove and desire and hate;\nI think they have no portion in us after\nWe pass the gate. They are not long, the days of wine and roses:\nOut of a misty dream\nOur path emerges for a while, then closes\nWithin a dream. Johnny Mercer had also written the lyrics for the theme from \"Laura\", a 1944 film in which Dowson's poem is quoted in its entirety. Miller's teleplay for \"Playhouse 90\", also titled \"Days of Wine and Roses\", had received favorable critical attention and was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category Best Writing of a Single Dramatic Program - One Hour or Longer.

The skeleton was articulated and only missing about the last of the tail and front legs. Both scapulae and coracoids are preserved in position, but the rest of the front legs are gone (except for phalanges and pieces of the humeri, ulnae, and radii).

The game's only goal was scored by Haitian-born U.S. center forward Joe Gaetjens. This game and the U.S. team were profiled by author Geoffrey Douglas in his book \"The Game of Their Lives\", which was made into a film of the same name (later renamed \"The Miracle Match\"). Background. The 1950 FIFA World Cup was England's World Cup debut, the Football Association having boycotted the previous three tournaments owing to a dispute with FIFA over payments made to amateur players, which had been resolved four years earlier. England and the United States were both drawn in Group 2, along with Spain and Chile: under the rules of the competition only the group winner from this four-nation round-robin would progress to the final stage. Each team had played one previous match in the group, England having beaten Chile 2–0 and the United States losing 3–1 to Spain.

With eight minutes left, Charlie Colombo brought down Mortensen with an illegal tackle at the edge of the penalty area. England pleaded for a penalty kick, but the referee ruled it was outside the box. From Alf Ramsey's resulting free kick, Jimmy Mullen headed the ball for what he thought was a goal, but Borghi tipped it away at the last instant, and despite the protests of the English players, the referee ruled that the ball had not crossed the line and thus there was no goal. England did not threaten again, but the U.S. had one final chance in the 85th minute: Frank \"Peewee\" Wallace drew Williams out of position and fired a shot at the empty net, only to be denied by a sliding goal line clearance by Ramsey.

The English counterattacked with three successive clear shots at the goal in minutes 30, 31, and 32, but failed to score. Mortensen twice went over the crossbar, and Tom Finney's header to the top corner was tipped away by Borghi.

The first event was held in Lucerne, Switzerland, in 1962. The event then was held every four years until 1974, when it became an annual competition. Also in 1974, men's lightweight and women's open weight events were added to the championships. Initially, men's events were 2000 metres long and women's events 1000 metres. At the 1984 World Championships in Montreal, Canada, women's lightweight demonstration events were raced over a 2000-metre course for the first time. In 1985, Women's lightweight events were officially added to the schedule and all mmen's and women's events were contested over a 2000-metre course. Since 1996, during (Summer) Olympic years, the World Rowing Junior Championships are held at the same time. In 2002 adaptive rowing events were introduced for the following classes of disability: LTA (legs, trunk and arms), TA (trunk, arms), and A (arms-only). In 2009 the A category was replaced by AS (arms and shoulders), and an ID (intellectually disabled) category was added (but then removed after the 2011 Championships).

The methods of retracting and storing the roof vary across eras and manufacturers. A convertible car's design allows an open-air driving experience, with the ability to provide a roof when required. A potential drawback of convertibles is their reduced structural rigidity (requiring significant engineering and modification to counteract the side effects of almost completely removing a car's roof). The majority of convertible roofs are of a folding construction framework with the actual top made from cloth or other fabric. Other types of convertible roofs include retractable hardtops (often constructed from metal or plastic) and detachable hardtops (where a metal or plastic roof is manually removed and often stored in the trunk). Terminology. Other terms for convertibles include cabriolet, cabrio, drop top, drophead coupé, open two-seater, open top, rag top, soft top, spider, and spyder, although companies use many of these terms interchangeably. Thus, nomenclatural consistency is rare. The term cabriolet originated from a carriage cabriolet: \"a light, two-wheeled, one-horse carriage with a folding top, capable of seating two persons\"; however, the term is also used to describe other convertibles. In the United Kingdom, the historical term for a two-door convertible is drophead coupé, and a four-door convertible was called an all-weather tourer. History.", "Most of the early automobiles were open-air vehicles without any roof or sides. As car engines became more powerful by the end of the 19th century, folding textile or leather roofs (as had been used on victoria or landau carriages) began to appear on cars. Examples of early cars with roofs include the phaeton (a two-seat car with a temporary roof), the brougham or a coupé de ville, having an enclosed passenger compartment at the rear, while the driver sat in front either in the open, or the landaulet, where the driver has a fixed roof and the passenger compartment has a folding roof. Less expensive cars, such as the runabouts, sporting roadsters, or sturdy touring cars, remained either completely open air or were fitted with a rudimentary folding top and detachable clear side curtains. In the 1920s, when steel bodies began to be mass-produced, closed cars became available to the average buyer, and fully open cars began to disappear from the mainstream market. By the mid 1930s, the remaining small number of convertibles sold were high-priced luxury models. In 1939, Plymouth introduced the first mechanically operated convertible roof powered by two vacuum cylinders. Demand for convertibles increased as a result of American soldiers in France and the United Kingdom during World War II familiarizing themselves with small roadster cars, which were not available in the United States at that time. These roadsters included the MG Midget and Triumph Roadster. The convertible design was incorporated into the mass market unibody by Hudson in 1948.", "A \"soft top\" is made from a flexible textile material:\nOther materials are also used in the convertible top. By 1955, the most popular materials were latex and butyl rubber fabrics that each accounted for around 35% of the convertible top's weight, with others included vinyl (12%), jute (8%), along with rayon and acrylic fibers (Orlon), amounting to about 1% each in the compositions. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) material was used for many convertible tops. The material consists of two layers: a top layer made of PVC, which has a specific structure depending on the vehicle model, and a lower layer made of fabric (usually cotton). The collapsible textile roof section over an articulated folding frame may include linings such as a sound-deadening layer and/or an interior cosmetic lining, to hide the frame. The folded convertible mechanism with the top is called the stack. Designs that fold down to a lower stack height offer a smoother silhouette for the car with the top down while concealed side rails allow room for three passengers in the back seat such as on the 1967 Rambler Rebel convertible. Detachable hardtop. Rigid removable hardtops, many of which can be stored in a car's trunk/boot, have been available at least since the 1950s. These usually provide greater weatherproofing, soundproofing, and durability compared to fabric-based tops; some are available with integrated rear-window defrosters and windscreens.", "Part of a building\nA storey (British English) or story (American English), is any level part of a building with a floor that could be used by people (for living, work, storage, recreation, etc.). Plurals for the word are \"storeys\" (UK) and \"stories\" (US). The terms \"floor\", \"level\", or \"deck\" are used in similar ways (i.e. \"the 16th \"floor\"\"), but to refer to buildings it is more usual to speak of a \"16-\"storey\" building\". The floor at ground or street level is called the \"ground floor\" (i.e. it needs no number; the floor below it is called \"basement\", and the floor above it is called \"first\") in many regions. However, in some regions, like the US, \"ground floor\" is synonymous with \"first floor\", leading to differing numberings of floors, depending on region – even between different national varieties of English. The words \"storey\" and \"floor\" normally exclude levels of the building that are not covered by a roof, such as the terrace on the rooftops of many buildings. Nevertheless, a flat roof on a building \"is\" counted as a floor in other languages, for instance in Dutch, literally \"roof-floor\", simply counted one level up from the floor number that it covers. A two-storey house or home extension is sometimes referred to as double-storey in the UK, while one storey is referred to as single-storey. Overview.", "United States automakers manufactured a broad range of convertible models during the 1950s and 1960s – from economical compact-sized models such as the Rambler American and the Studebaker Lark, to the more expensive models, such as the Packard Caribbean, Oldsmobile 98, and Imperial by Chrysler. Automakers often included a convertible body style as an available body style in a model range. Convertibles in the U.S. market peaked in sales around 1965, and fell in popularity over the next five years. Optional air conditioning was gradually becoming more popular, and the availability of sunroofs and T-tops limited the appeal of the open body style. Noise, leaks, and repairs associated with fabric tops also contributed to issues that many customers had. The popularity of convertibles was reduced by the increased travel speeds on roads (resulting in more wind and noise for occupants) and the emergence of more comprehensive vehicle crash safety standards in the United States. The market share of convertibles fell to two or three percent of total sales and the U.S. automakers discontinued the body style from their lineups. American Motors stopped making convertibles after the 1968 model year, Chrysler after 1971, Ford after 1973, and most divisions of General Motors after 1975. Cadillac held out until 1976, when they made about 14,000. The last 200 had a red, white, and blue motif and a dashboard plaque.

History. The band was formed by a group of friends who grew up together in the Woodbine-Lumsden neighbourhood of East York while its original four members (Romaniuk, Young, Paulin and Saarinen) were in elementary school. The group originally played under the names Unreal and El Mo before settling on Still Life Still. After many local gigs, they were discovered by fledgling indie DIY label and studio Mushroom Productions, who heard (via MySpace) and saw their early potential at an NXNE fest in 2005. The label met them at that gig and invited them to record and develop. A week later they were in the studio, recording many of their pivotal early songs. Mushroom released two albums of early live recordings, and two demo ep's that were released in 2006 and 2007, by Mushroom (although physical copies are rare), featuring Alanna J Brown, who grew up with the band.

Broader examples include the docufiction and docudrama, which merge the basic categories of fiction and non-fiction (documentary). Genres are not fixed; they change and evolve over time, and some genres may largely disappear (for example, the melodrama). Not only does \"genre\" refer to a type of film or its category, a key role is also played by the expectations of an audience about a film, as well as institutional discourses that create generic structures. Overview. Characteristics. Characteristics of particular genres are most evident in genre films, which are \"commercial feature films [that], through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations\" in a given genre. Drawing heavily from the theories of literary-genre criticism, film genres are usually delineated by conventions, iconography, narratives, formats, characters, and actors, all of which can vary according to the genre. In terms of standard or \"stock\" characters, those in film noir, for example, include the femme fatale and the \"hardboiled\" detective; while those in Westerns, stock characters include the schoolmarm and the gunslinger. Regarding actors, some may acquire a reputation linked to a single genre, such as John Wayne (the Western) or Fred Astaire (the musical).", "A Single Life is a 1985 Australian film directed by John Power and starring Tina Bursill and Steve Jacobs.

The band spent late March and April 1978 writing and rehearsing material. During the Stiff/Chiswick Challenge concert at Manchester's Rafters club on 14 April, they caught the attention of TV music presenter Tony Wilson and manager Rob Gretton. Curtis berated Wilson for not putting the group on his Granada Television show \"So It Goes\"; Wilson responded that Joy Division would be the next band he would showcase on TV. Gretton, the venue's resident DJ, was so impressed by the band's performance that he convinced them to take him on as their manager.

The group consisted of vocalist, guitarist and lyricist Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. Sumner and Hook formed the band after attending a June 1976 Sex Pistols concert. While Joy Division's first recordings were heavily influenced by early punk rock, they soon developed a sparse sound and style that made them one of the pioneering groups of the post-punk genre and movement. Their self-released 1978 debut EP \"An Ideal for Living\" drew the attention of the Manchester television personality Tony Wilson, who signed them to his independent label Factory Records. Their debut album \"Unknown Pleasures\", recorded with producer Martin Hannett, was released in 1979. Curtis struggled with personal problems, including a failing marriage, depression, and epilepsy. As the band's popularity grew, Curtis's health condition made it increasingly difficult for him to perform; he occasionally experienced seizures on stage. He died by suicide on the eve of what would have been the band's first North American tour in May 1980, aged 23. Joy Division's second and final album, \"Closer\", was released two months later; it and the single \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" became their highest-charting releases.

Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band the Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join the Panik, and even had Curtis audition. On 18 July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions. Driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off. In August 1977, Warsaw placed an advertisement in a music shop window seeking a replacement drummer. Stephen Morris, who had attended the same school as Curtis, was the sole respondent. Deborah Curtis, Ian's wife, stated that Morris \"fitted perfectly\" with the band, and that with his addition Warsaw became a \"complete 'family'\". To avoid confusion with the London punk band Warsaw Pakt, the band renamed themselves Joy Division in early 1978, borrowing the name from the sexual slavery wing of a Nazi concentration camp mentioned in the 1955 novel \"House of Dolls\".

The river flows through several more reservoirs before reaching Austin, including Lake Buchanan, Inks Lake, Lake Lyndon B. Johnson (commonly referred to as Lake LBJ), and Lake Travis. The Llano River joins the Colorado at Lake LBJ near Kingsland, and the Pedernales River joins at Lake Travis near Briarcliff. After passing through Austin, the Colorado River continues flowing southeast until emptying into Matagorda Bay on the Gulf of Mexico, near Matagorda. History.

In 1757, Spanish Texas attempted to establish an outlying Catholic mission (Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá) on the San Saba River, near its confluence with the Colorado River. Nearly defenseless and viewed by the Comanche tribe as a territorial invasion, the mission was sacked in 1758 by about 2,000 Comanches and their allies. The Comanche were not effectively challenged on the upper Colorado River for nearly a century. River modifications. The river is an important source of water for farming, cities, and electrical power production. Major man-made reservoirs on the river include Lake Buchanan, Inks Lake, Lake LBJ, Lake Marble Falls, Lake Travis, Lake Austin, Town Lake now called Lady Bird Lake in Austin. Collectively, these lakes are known as the Highland Lakes. In addition to power plants operating on each of the major lakes, waters of the Colorado are used for cooling the South Texas Nuclear Project near Bay City. The Colorado River Municipal Water District owns and operates three reservoirs upstream of the Highland Lakes: Lake J. B. Thomas near Snyder, E.V. Spence Reservoir near Robert Lee, and O.H.

Labuschagne was a member of the Australian team that won the 2023 ICC World Test Championship final and the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup. Labuschagne was born in Klerksdorp, North West Province, South Africa. He represented Queensland at various levels in junior cricket, before making his first-class cricket debut in 2014. In August 2019, Labuschagne was the first cricketer to become a concussion substitute in a Test match, replacing Steve Smith. Labuschagne was the leading run-scorer in Test matches in 2019. He rose to fourth place in the ICC Player Rankings during the year, a rise of 106 places. In January 2020, Labuschagne was named as the ICC Men's Emerging Cricketer of the Year by the International Cricket Council (ICC), in February as Australia's Test player of the year, and in April as one of the five Cricketers of the Year by \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\".

During that series he became the first bowler to register identical figures in each innings of a test (6 for 52). Chandrasekhar had minimal batting skills, finishing with a Test average of 4.07. He was given a special Gray-Nicholls bat during the 1977–78 Australian tour with a hole in it to commemorate the four ducks he scored, and he has 23 Test ducks to his credit. He also holds the dubious distinction of scoring less runs (167) off his bat than wickets (242) taken in Test cricket; the only other cricketer with this distinction over a significant Test career is New Zealand fast bowler Chris Martin.

It is owned by Gray Television alongside dual NBC/Telemundo affiliate KHNL (channel 13) and Kailua-Kona–licensed KFVE (channel 6), which relays KHNL's second and sixth digital subchannels. The stations share studios on Waiakamilo Road in Honolulu's Kapālama neighborhood; KGMB's transmitter is located in Akupu, Hawaii. History. The station first signed on the air on December 1, 1952, as the second television station in Hawaii. KGMB-TV was originally owned by J. Howard Worrall along with KGMB radio (AM 590, now KSSK) and operated from studios on Kapiolani Boulevard in Honolulu. The station carried programming from three of the four major networks at the time (excluding DuMont), but was a primary CBS affiliate owing to KGMB-AM's long affiliation with CBS Radio. The station lost NBC programming when KONA-TV (channel 2, now KHON-TV) signed on two weeks later, and lost ABC when KULA-TV (channel 4, now KITV) launched in April 1954. In 1973, a partnership led by future Hawaii congressman Cecil Heftel bought KGMB-AM-TV, then turned around and sold the KGMB stations to Lee Enterprises in 1977. Lee sold off the radio station in 1980.", "In 1982, the station dropped the \"-TV\" suffix from its call sign. The real-life KGMB news crew was often featured in one of the longest-running police dramas on CBS in the 1970s, \"Hawaii Five-O\". The station also had ties to the iconic series' reboot, as CBS allowed KGMB to let its viewers preview the season premiere episode early at the Waikiki Shell each September during the rebooted series' run. In 2000, Lee exited from television broadcasting and sold most of its television holdings (including KGMB) to Emmis Communications. Emmis already owned KHON-TV, so it had to obtain a cross-ownership waiver for the purchase of KGMB from the Federal Communications Commission, to bypass the recently passed duopoly rules that forbid common ownership of two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market. This waiver was renewed several times while Emmis owned both stations. At that time, KHON moved its operations into KGMB's facility, though the two stations maintained separate news departments. From September 2, 2002, to October 31, 2004, KGMB carried select UPN programming via a secondary affiliation shared with KHON; each station aired programs from that network that the other station did not air. The two stations began carrying UPN programming in September 2002 after KFVE (which had been with UPN since its January 1995 launch) disaffiliated from the network to become a full-time affiliate of The WB (whose programming aired on KFVE in a secondary capacity since December 1998).", "ABC affiliate in Salt Lake City\nKTVX (channel 4) is a television station in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, affiliated with ABC. It is owned by Nexstar Media Group alongside Ogden-licensed CW owned-and-operated station KUCW (channel 30). The two stations share studios on West 1700 South in Salt Lake City; KTVX's transmitter is located atop Farnsworth Peak in the Oquirrh Mountains. KTVX has a large network of broadcast translators that extend its over-the-air coverage throughout Utah, as well as portions of Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming. History. KTVX traces its history back to the November 1946 sign-on of W6XIS, the first television station in Utah, which operated under an experimental broadcast license. The station began regular broadcasts on April 19, 1948 as KDYL-TV; it was originally owned by the Mountain Broadcasting Corporation (operated by Sid Fox), along with KDYL radio (1320 AM, now KNIT, and 98.7 FM, now KBEE). The floor in the original studio facility was sloped and cameras would easily roll. The station's original transmitter sat atop the Walker Bank Building. Channel 4 originally operated as an NBC affiliate owing to KDYL-AM's longtime affiliation with the NBC Red Network; the radio station had been one of the network's original 26 affiliates when it launched in 1926.", "Later, with an emphasis on weather, the station branded itself \"Hawaii's Severe Weather Station\". Channel swap. On August 18, 2009, MCG Capital and Raycom Media (owner of KHNL and, at the time, KFVE) announced a shared services agreement with Raycom as senior partner. As part of the deal, KGMB vacated its longtime studios on Kapiolani Boulevard; the combined operation would be based at KHNL/KFVE's studios on Waiakamilo Road. Though non-news programming would remain in place, news operations of the three stations would be combined into a single entity. The arrangement would also see a channel swap, with KGMB moving from virtual channel 9 (UHF digital channel 23) to channel 5 (UHF digital channel 22) and KFVE move from 5 to 9. The resulting ownership arrangement of the stations generated some controversy, as it had the effect of Raycom trading KFVE to MCG Capital in return for KGMB. Organizations such as media watchdog group Media Council Hawaii viewed the plan as a way to circumvent FCC rules preventing one company owning two of the four highest-rated stations in the same market—in this case, KGMB and KHNL. However, the FCC only recognizes ownership of facility identifications, which remain attached to their channel numbers, and not ownership of a station's intellectual unit (call letters, programming, network affiliation, etc.).", "KIKU, an independent station specializing in Japanese programming, became a secondary UPN affiliate on November 1, 2004, and remained with the network until its closure on September 15, 2006. Emmis itself prepared to exit the television industry and sold KHON to the Montecito Broadcast Group in 2006. Emmis then announced on February 20, 2007, that KGMB and its satellites had been sold to MCG Capital Corporation for $40 million, resulting in one of the rare instances involving a complete separation of a television station duopoly. The FCC approved the sale in late May and was completed on June 4, 2007. Shortly after MCG Capital Corporation took over, KGMB adopted a logo similar to the one it used in the early 1980s and also rolled out a new graphics package for its newscast and a new website. For many years, KGMB billed itself as \"One of the Good Things About Hawaii\" with its rich history of local television programming exclusively in Hawaii, especially in such shows as \"Skipper Al\" and \"Checkers &amp; Pogo\" (both children's programs; the latter being the most remembered, airing from 1967 to 1982 and featured Morgan White), \"The Hawaii Moving Company\" (originally a disco/dance program that transitioned into a general interest show), and the 1982 television special \"Rap's Hawaii\" starring Rap Reiplinger.

He likely studied with Palestrina, and was a skilled and prolific composer, especially of cyclic madrigals of the type popular in Rome. Life. Mel was born in Mechelen to an aristocratic family closely connected to the Duchy of Lorraine; his father was in charge of the financial management of the Duke's estate. In 1562, at the probable age of eight, he began study at the Cathedral of St. Rombaut, with Séverin Cornet being his principal teacher. In 1572, after finishing his schooling, he was sent to Lisbon by his family, where he may have served as \"maestro di cappella\" at the court (according to Giuseppe Baini, the 19th century writer on music, who was not always a reliable source). By 1580 he was in Rome, possibly studying with Palestrina. Records indicate he was at Chieti in 1583, and in January 1584 in Venice; in July of that year he accepted a position as \"maestro di cappella\" at Rieti Cathedral, but was dismissed shortly thereafter for being too often absent from his duties. Between 1585 and 1591 Mel traveled widely, returning to Flanders, including Liège and Antwerp. He served briefly as \"maestro di cappella\" for the Duke of Bavaria, then in Liège, for at least a few months beginning in July 1587.", "He visited Venice, Rome, Magliano Capo di Sabina, and Aquila during the years 1585 to 1591 as well. Between 1591 and 1597 he was music director at the cathedral and seminary in Magliano Capo di Sabina. He disappears from the record after 1597, but a book of newly composed chansons by him, published in Antwerp that year, has suggested that he may have again returned to the land of his birth. Music. All of Rinaldo del Mel's surviving music is vocal, and it is both sacred and secular. He was a prolific composer, and wrote both motets and madrigals, as well as some forms that blended elements of the sacred and secular, such as a collection of \"spiritual canzonets\". His style shows the craftsmanship of an exceptional Netherlandish musical training, as well as the influence of Palestrina, who was probably his teacher, as claimed by Baini. Mel's sacred music, as would be expected of a composer of the Roman School, is more conservative stylistically than his secular music. Since his music is yet to appear in a modern edition it has not been fully evaluated by scholars. Mel wrote several sets of cyclic madrigals, i.e. sets of madrigals which set successive stanzas of a long poem (Monteverdi's \"Sestina: Lagrime d'Amante al Sepolcro dell'Amata\" is probably the most famous example of a cyclic madrigal set).", "Argentine writer (1935–2002)\nEduardo Gudiño Kieffer (November 2, 1935 – September 20, 2002) was an Argentine writer.

He was part of the Latin American literature boom of the 1960s. He graduated as a lawyer at the Universidad del Litoral in Santa Fe but never practiced law.

Its name is associated with the mythical condition of lycanthropy, a supernatural affliction in which humans are said to physically shapeshift into wolves. The term is used by researchers mostly in the broader sense of transformation into animals in general, that, strictly speaking, is described as zoanthropy. Signs and symptoms. Affected individuals believe that they are in the process of transforming into an animal, or have already transformed into an animal. Clinical Lycanthropy has been associated with the altered states of mind that accompany psychosis, the mental state that typically involves delusions and hallucinations, with the transformation only seeming to happen in the mind and behavior of the affected person. A 1988 study on clinical lycanthropy from the McLean Hospital reported on a series of cases, and proposed some diagnostic criteria by which clinical lycanthropy could be recognised:\nAccording to these criteria, either a delusional belief in current or past transformation or behavior that suggests a person thinks of themselves as transformed is considered evidence of clinical lycanthropy. The authors note that, although the condition seems to be an expression of psychosis, there is no specific diagnosis of mental or neurological illness associated with its behavioral consequences. Clinical lycanthropy is not specific to an experience of human-to-wolf transformation.", "A wide variety of creatures have been reported as part of the shape-shifting experience. A 2004 review of the medical literature lists over thirty published cases of clinical lycanthropy, only the minority of which have wolf (Lycanthropy) or dog (Cynanthropy) themes. Canines are certainly not uncommon, although the experience of being transformed into other animals such as a hyena, cat, horse, bird, or tiger has been reported on more than one occasion. Transformation into frogs, and even bees, has been reported in some instances. The term \"ophidianthropy\" refers to the delusion that one has been transformed into a snake, of which two case studies have been reported. In Japan, transformation into foxes and dogs was common (, ). A 1989 case study described how one individual reported a serial transformation, experiencing a change from human to dog, to a horse, and then to a cat, before returning to the reality of human existence after treatment. There are also reports of people who experienced transformation into an animal only listed as \"unspecified.\" Proposed mechanisms. Clinical lycanthropy is a very rare condition and is largely considered to be an idiosyncratic expression of a psychotic or dissociative episode caused by another condition such as Dissociative Identity Disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or clinical depression. It has also been associated with drug intoxication and withdrawal, cerebrovascular disease, traumatic brain injury, dementia, delirium, and seizures.", "However, there are suggestions that certain neurological conditions and cultural influences may result in the expression of the human-animal transformation theme that defines the condition. Neurological factors. One important factor may be differences or changes in parts of the brain known to be involved in representing body shape (e.g., see proprioception and body image). A neuroimaging study of two people diagnosed with clinical lycanthropy showed that these areas display unusual activation, suggesting that when people report their bodies are changing shape, they may be genuinely perceiving those feelings. Treatment. Because clinical lycanthropy is strongly associated with psychotic disorders, antipsychotic medication is often an effective treatment. It may also be treated with antidepressants or mood stabilizers, in cases in which it is a symptom of depression or bipolar disorder. Patients with clinical lycanthropy may also benefit from a cultural approach to treatment, as the syndrome is generally agreed to be culture-bound. Related disorders. Clinical lycanthropy is a type of delusional misidentification syndrome of the self, and it often overlaps with other delusional misidentification syndromes. For example, there is a case study of a psychiatric patient who had both clinical lycanthropy and Cotard delusion. In rare cases, individuals may believe that other people have transformed into animals. This has been termed \"lycanthropic intermetamorphosis\" and \"lycanthropy spectrum.\"", "A 2009 study reported that, after the consumption of the drug MDMA (Ecstasy), a man displayed symptoms of paranoid psychosis by claiming that his relatives had changed into various animals such as a boar, a donkey, and a horse. History. Catherine Clark Kroeger has written that several parts of the Bible refer to King Nebuchadnezzar's behavior in the book of Daniel 4 as being a manifestation of clinical lycanthropy. Neurologist Andrew J. Larner has written that the fate of Odysseus's crew due to the magic of Circe may be one of the earliest examples of clinical lycanthropy. It is believed that the Armenian king Tiridates III also had this disorder. He was cured by Gregory the Illuminator. According to Persian tradition, the Buyid prince Majd al-Dawla was experiencing an illusion that he was a cow. He was cured by Ibn Sina. Notions that lycanthropy was due to a medical condition go back to the seventh century, when the Alexandrian physician Paulus Aegineta attributed lycanthropy to melancholia or an \"excess of black bile\". In 1563, a Lutheran physician named Johann Weyer wrote that werewolves had an imbalance in their melancholic humour and exhibited the physical symptoms of paleness, \"a dry tongue and a great thirst\" as well as sunken, dim and dry eyes.", "Initially when children begin to have social interactions with others, mainly the caregivers, they misinterpret that they are one entity, because they are together for a long duration of time and the caregivers often provide for the children's needs. For example, a child may misattribute the act of their mother reaching to retrieve an object that they point to as a sign that they are the same entity, when in fact they are actually separate individuals. As early as 15 months old, children show a mix of egocentrism and theory of mind when an agent acts inconsistently with how the children expect them to behave. In a 2005 study, the children observed the experimenter place a toy inside one of two boxes but did not see when the experimenter removed the toy from the original box and placed it in the other box, due to obstruction by a screen. When the screen was removed the children watched the experimenter reach to take the toy out of one of the boxes, yet because the children did not see the switching part, they looked at the experimenter's action much longer when she reached for the box opposite to the one she originally put the toy in. Not only does this show the existence of infants' memory capacity, but it also demonstrates how they have expectations based on their knowledge, as they are surprised when those expectations are not met."], "distances": [0.3063194751739502, 0.4090714454650879, 0.4767346978187561, 0.6268469095230103, 0.6597734093666077], "supports": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "metadatas": [{"pool_index": 1285, "doc_name": "Clinical lycanthropy", "mapped_id": "028633ba-c1b3-4705-8045-1b419bea970e", "support": 1}, {"doc_name": "Clinical lycanthropy", "support": 1, "pool_index": 1286, "mapped_id": "028633ba-c1b3-4705-8045-1b419bea970e"}, {"doc_name": "Clinical lycanthropy", "mapped_id": "028633ba-c1b3-4705-8045-1b419bea970e", "support": 1, "pool_index": 1287}, {"support": 1, "doc_name": "Clinical lycanthropy", "mapped_id": "028633ba-c1b3-4705-8045-1b419bea970e", "pool_index": 1288}, {"mapped_id": "0b0528f5-2381-4d05-83d4-4a24212abc1b", "pool_index": 2301, "support": 1, "doc_name": "Egocentrism"}], "recall": 1.0, "precision": 1.0, "ndcg": 1.0, "mrr": 1.0}

In the North American plains, the wheat production axis that extends over a length of in a north–south direction from central Alberta to central Texas is known as the Wheat Belt. Hard red winter wheat is grown in the Central U.S. states of Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, Oklahoma, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, and Texas and Some Northwestern United States such as Washington, Oregon and Idaho. In the hot climatic conditions of these states, winter wheat is raised by planting in fall and harvesting in the spring, taking advantage of autumn rains. Under harsh cold weather conditions in parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota where winter wheat cannot be grown, the crop is planted in the spring and grows during the long summer days of the high latitudes so that it can be harvested in the fall. Classification and uses. Of wheat grown in the United States, 36% percent is consumed domestically by humans, 50% is exported, 10% is used for livestock feed, and 4% is used for seedlings. Various American-style wheat beers are produced in the US. Wheat in the U.S. is grown under two major categories based on climate: winter wheat, and spring wheat. The majority is winter wheat, accounting for, on average, 75% of wheat production. Wheat may be further classified as follows:\nThe byproducts resulting from milling of all the above varieties is used to feed animals. Enrichment.", "Wheat in the United States\nWheat is produced in almost every state in the United States, and is one of the most grown grains in the country. The type and quantity vary between regions. The US is ranked fourth in production volume of wheat, with almost 50 million tons produced in 2020, behind only China, India and Russia. The US is ranked first in crop export volume; almost 50% of its total wheat production is exported. The United States Department of Agriculture defines eight official classes of wheat: durum wheat, hard red spring wheat, hard red winter wheat, soft red winter wheat, hard white wheat, soft white wheat, unclassed wheat, and mixed wheat. Winter wheat accounts for 70 to 80 percent of total production in the US, with the largest amounts produced in Kansas (10.8 million tons) and North Dakota (9.8 million tons). The US hard red spring wheat crop is exported to over 70 countries each year to the extent of 55%. Of the total wheat produced in the country, 50% is exported, valued at US$9 billion. History. According to Ricardo Alegria, wheat was first cultivated in New Spain by afro-spanish conquistador Juan Garrido in the 16th century. Although it was first introduced to the Western Hemisphere following the discovery of the New World, wheat came to be grown in North American soil only during the colonial period. During the colonial period, wheat was sown by broadcasting, reaped by sickles, and threshed by flails. The kernels were then taken to a grist mill for grinding into flour.", "In 1830, it took four people and two oxen, working 10 hours a day, to produce 200 bushels. The geographic center of wheat-growing areas in the U.S. in 1839 was to the north and west of Washington, D.C., and spread further over time to the far west of the country. Production conditions also resulted in extending the wheat growing areas into harsher climatic regions. Data on wheat production is available for the period between 1885 and 1930. Improvements in wheat breeding in the U.S. was an activity of the state agricultural experiment stations, while the federal officials concentrated on exploring possibilities of gaining from appropriate varieties developed in other parts of the world. After the American Civil War, the western Mississippi Valley and the Great Plains to its west, where large fertile lands were available, resulted in expanding wheat farming. By this time, better tillage equipment was in use, railroads provided better access to world markets, better trading and warehousing facilities were facilitated, and more particularly introduction of hard winter was introduced. In the 1870s, Turkey red wheat, a hard variety of wheat, was introduced to the farmlands of Kansas by Russian Mennonite immigrants. This wheat variety spread quickly. New technology substantially enhanced productivity in the 19th century, as sowing with drills replaced broadcasting, cradles took the place of sickles, and the cradles in turn were replaced by reapers and binders. Steam-powered threshing machines superseded flails.", "By 1895, in Bonanza farms in the Dakotas, it took six different people and 36 horses pulling huge harvesters, working 10 hours a day, to produce 20,000 bushels. Following the invention of the steel roller mill in 1878, hard varieties of wheat such as Turkey Red became more popular than soft, which had been previously preferred because they were easier for grist mills to grind. Exports from 1914 to 1922 amounted to more than 200 million bushels. The annual wheat production of the United States more than tripled in the fifty years between 1871 and 1921; it increased from about 250 million bushels during the period of 1869–1871 to over 750 million during the period of 1919–1921. With recorded wheat production of more than its domestic consumption (production was as much as 2.5 times the consumption), as World War II started, wheat stocks could not be lifted and the result was its use as livestock feed and for industrial alcohol. After the war years, there were four \"best\" years (1945–1948) when the average annual production peaked to 1,228 million bushels, double the production of war years. In 2002, 50% of the U.S. wheat crop was exported, while 36% was consumed by the American population, and 10% was fed to livestock, with the remaining 4% set aside for seed. Wheat harvesting occurs on land area of 60–63 million acres. Genetically modified wheat, which \"is not approved for cultivation anywhere in the world\", was found in an Oregon farm in June 2013. The grain was modified by Monsanto to tolerate weed killer treatments.", "Kentucky is an agricultural producer in the United States. Value of agricultural products was $5 billion in 2012, of which slightly less than half was crops. Crops grown in the state include corn, soybeans, hay, wheat and tobacco.

Kentucky's bluegrass region contains the state's best farmland. By contrast, the agricultural potential of the Knobs region (which borders the Bluegrass region) is limited because of its inferior soil and steep topography.

In \"My Friend the Doctor\", he slam dunks a basketball to show off, but injures his back when he lands. Out of vanity, he tries to hide the injury. He is extremely narcissistic and egocentric; when named by a magazine as the best doctor in the city, he lines up every staff member beneath him, as well as his ex-wife, to praise him or risk a physical reprisal from the Janitor (Neil Flynn). While he goes out of his way to distance himself from others, Cox often gets mixed up in the lives of both his patients and those around him. This personal involvement often manifests in destructive ways, with Cox externalizing his feelings to those around him. Despite this, he has intervened in some situations to help others with no expectation of personal gain and often to his own detriment, like when he punches Kelso in the face in front of the entire staff when Kelso berates Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke). According to McGinley in the Season 1 DVD bonus features, Cox's habit of touching his nose is a homage to Paul Newman's character in \"The Sting\", although Cox also uses it as a sign of irritation on occasion, rather than just signifying \"it's going to be OK\", as in the film. Dr. Cox has also been compared to Gregory House. This is further explored in \"My House\", during which Cox acquires a temporary limp.", "Percival Ulysses \"Perry\" Cox, M.D., is a fictional character played by John C. McGinley on the American television comedy drama \"Scrubs\". Cox appears in every episode except for \"My Last Words\", \"My Comedy Show\", and \"My Full Moon\", all from Season 8. John McGinley, Zach Braff, and Donald Faison were the only cast members who returned as regulars for Season 9. Ken Jenkins, Sarah Chalke, and Neil Flynn made guest appearances. Character profile. Cox is a sarcastic, cynical, misanthrope who has a quick wit normally expressed through frequent and sometimes very long rants. These rants were often handed to McGinley the night before, or on the day of recording. At the beginning of the series, he is the attending physician at Sacred Heart Hospital; he is later promoted to residency director and, by the eighth season, to chief of medicine. In the ninth and final season, he becomes a professor when Sacred Heart is turned into a medical school. He is the superior of and unwilling mentor to the series' protagonist, John \"J.D.\" Dorian (Zach Braff). He has a \"married but not married\" relationship with his equally acerbic ex-wife, Jordan Sullivan (Christa Miller), with whom he has a son, Jack, and a daughter, Jennifer Dylan. He treats virtually everyone in the hospital with derision, especially his longtime nemesis, chief of medicine Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins).", "According to a 2006 interview with McGinley, Cox's reason for hating Jackman may be that Bill Lawrence envies the actor's talent. Cox is occasionally seen wearing a Detroit Red Wings jersey. McGinley is a Red Wings fan and a close friend of former Detroit defenceman Chris Chelios, whose name is on the back of Cox's jersey. He has also worn a Cheli's Chili Bar T-shirt, a small chain of restaurants owned by Chelios. Cox is a graduate of Hale University and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the former being a fictional adaptation of Yale University. Cox is often seen drinking scotch and has acknowledged (humorously) that he has a drinking problem. Cox drinks so much that J.D. fears that Cox will die of liver disease. After making a mistake that results in three deaths, a guilt-ridden Cox goes to work drunk and falls into a deep depression. J.D. eventually helps him forgive himself. Cox's son Jack's first full sentence is \"Daddy drinks a lot\". Relationships with other characters. In Sacred Heart. Cox constantly berates the residents, giving John \"J.D.\" Dorian female nicknames (e.g. \"Tiffany\", \"Jennifer\", \"Carol\", \"Betsy\", \"Lindsey\") and regularly calling him \"Newbie\".", "At the end of the episode, Cox walks into the room where the other characters are and gives them the answers to everything they have been trying to figure out throughout the episode, in a way reminiscent of House. Cox becomes chief of medicine after Kelso retires, but it does not come easily. He temporarily holds the position until the board finds a replacement, Dr. Taylor Maddox (Courteney Cox). After concluding that Maddox is worse than Kelso, Cox teams up with the Janitor and Kelso to oust her. After Maddox is fired, the position is vacant until Kelso, unbeknownst to Cox, recommends him for the job. Cox is initially hesitant to take the job out of fear of losing the connection he has with his patients. After a few days, Kelso convinces him to accept the position. In the Season 2 DVD commentary of \"His Story\", series creator Bill Lawrence stated that Cox always knows if someone is standing behind him, as well as who it is, without turning around to check. This quirk is subverted in \"My Finale\" when J.D. stands behind Cox as he tells one of the new interns how he really feels; throughout the speech, he gives no sign that he knows that J.D. is behind him. He is also a very good golfer, regularly besting Kelso. Cox harbors an intense hatred for Hugh Jackman, mentioning him frequently in his rants throughout the series.", "He also calls Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke) \"Barbie\", Turk (Donald Faison) \"Gandhi\" and Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins) \"Bob-O\", \"Bobcat\", \"Bobmeister\", \"Big Bob\", and \"Beelzebob\". The one person he openly admits to tolerating is head nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes). Throughout Season 1, he and Turk compete for her affections, with Cox eventually bowing out when he sees that Turk and Carla are in love. In one episode, it is seen that Cox helped Turk with how to deal with women when they are mad, Turk eventually taking Perry's advice. Turk soon learns that Carla and Cox went on a date before Turk came to the hospital. Despite his contempt for Turk in early seasons, Cox develops a restrained level of respect for him, and even occasionally gets along with and relates to him. In the Season 6 episode, \"My Road To Nowhere\", when complications are found with his unborn child he insists that Turk assist with the surgery. Being reluctant at first, he even appoints Turk as the Chief Surgeon of Sacred Heart. Cox makes this decision after being told by Kelso that his own promotions by Kelso were against the latter's personal disdain for Cox, yet Cox's excellent medical knowledge made him the best candidate nonetheless - a feature that Turk shares with Cox.

Ambulatory care includes those clinical, organizational and professional activities engaged in by registered nurses with and for individuals, groups, and populations who seek assistance with improving health and/or seek care for health-related problems. The American Academy of Ambulatory Care Nursing (AAACN) describes ambulatory care nursing as a comprehensive practice which is built on a broad knowledge base of nursing and health sciences, and applies clinical expertise rooted in the nursing process. Ambulatory care nurses use evidence based information across a variety of outpatient health care settings to achieve and ensure patient safety and quality of care while improving patient outcomes. Contact with patients in ambulatory care is often relatively brief, and in the context of a high volume of patients. Nurses in this setting require sound assessment skills and the ability to guide patients in making informed health choices. Quality ambulatory care nursing has been associated with fewer emergency department visits, hospital visits and readmissions.

Safety. There have been concerns regarding the safety of ambulatory medicine. Some of the common potential sources of harm include errors to medications and diagnostics as well as breakdowns in communications and coordination of care. One major complication of ambulatory care that predisposes to patients to harm is the risk for missing appointments. Missed appointments are common, costly, and can lead to significant delays in both diagnosis and treatment. Advancements in information technology (IT) have helped to address some safety concerns of ambulatory medicine by minimizing mismanagement of electronic health records (EHR), improving interoperability, and increasing health professionals communication. Some have raised the notion of designing health professionals payment policies with greater focus on safety in addition to patient volumes. Furthermore, strategies for increased patient and caregiver engagement have been heralded as potentially beneficial in both patient care as well as data gathering for patient safety.

It is their first studio album since 1996's \"Stars and Stripes Vol. 1\", the first album to feature original material since \"Summer in Paradise\" in 1992, their first album to feature guitarist and backing vocalist David Marks since \"Little Deuce Coupe\" in 1963, and their first album since the 1998 death of co-founder Carl Wilson. Preceded by the single \"That's Why God Made the Radio\", the album reached number 3 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and was their highest charting studio album of new material since 1965, placing them second all-time with longest span of top 10 albums at 49 years. Background. Jim Peterik has said that the album's title came from a comment made by Brian in response to Peterik's description of an AM radio broadcast filtering through a car's oval speaker. According to record producer Joe Thomas, Brian Wilson circa 2008 or 2010 inquired to him about demo tapes recorded during the sessions for Wilson's 1998 solo album \"Imagination\" which Thomas co-produced: \"He called up and said I've got some ideas for some new Beach Boys songs, and I said, That’s great, and I pointed out to him that when we worked together several years ago he had the genesis of some other Beach Boys songs that he had never really wanted to put on any of his solo records.", "It just seemed like all these little pieces became like this theme, and instead of being Americana or whatever \"Smile\" was, it was his drive down Pacific Coast Highway. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSometimes he’ll have a great chorus and I’ll just add a couple lines in a verse.

And sometimes he won’t say anything, and then all of sudden he’ll come up with this brilliant melody while I’m playing the chords. —Joe Thomas\nMany of the songs were written in collaboration with Thomas, whose input sometimes included entire chord progressions. Classified as baroque pop, many of the songs have a considerable history: \"That's Why God Made the Radio\" was written by Brian Wilson, Jim Peterik, Joe Thomas and Larry Millas back in the late 1990s, and that \"about 80 hours worth\" of demo tapes were sourced from that period. \"Spring Vacation\" originated during \"Your Imagination\" and contained new lyrics by Love written reportedly in five minutes. The track \"Summer's Gone\" was originally meant to be the final song on the final Beach Boys album, and according to Thomas, the album's original title was \"Summer's Gone\" with the intention that it would be the final Beach Boys album.", "British actor and composer\nPhilip R.

In 1941 there was a strike against the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, of which Duke Ellington was a member. Because of the strike he could not air his songs on the radio. Instead, he used songs written by his son Mercer and pianist Billy Strayhorn. Strayhorn's compositions of this time include \"Take the 'A' Train\", \"Chelsea Bridge\" and \"Day Dream\". Mercer wrote \"Things Ain't What They Used to Be\", \"Blue Serge\" and \"Moon Mist\". Jazz musician and historian Chris Tyle argues that most likely Mercer Ellington came up with the melody and his father then arranged the song for the band.

The song first appeared on McLachlan's fourth studio album, \"Surfacing\", in 1997 and was released as the album's fourth and final single in September 1998. The lyrics are about the death of musician Jonathan Melvoin (1961–1996) from a heroin overdose, as McLachlan explained on \"VH1 Storytellers\". It is sometimes mistitled as \"In the Arms of an Angel\". or \"Arms of the Angel\". \"Angel\" was McLachlan's second consecutive top-five hit on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, peaking at number four. It also spent 12 weeks at number one on the \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary chart, placing as the number-one song on that chart for 1999. In McLachlan's native Canada, it reached number seven on the \"RPM\" 100 Hit Tracks chart and number three on the Adult Contemporary chart. Outside North America, the song has charted in several countries in the years following its release, including reaching number seven in Ireland in 2002 and number nine in Norway in 2008. Despite the meaning and subject matter of this song, \"Angel\" is often played at funerals and memorial services due to the lyrics, \"You're in the arms of the angel. May you find some comfort here\". Darryl McDaniels of the rap group, Run-DMC, credited Angel to saving his life when he was suicidal. Background.", "Biblical figure identified with fallen angel\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the name Azazel (; \"ʿĂzāʾzēl\") represents a desolate place where a scapegoat bearing the sins of the Jews was sent during Yom Kippur. During the late Second Temple period (after the closure of the Hebrew Bible canon), Azazel came to be viewed as a fallen angel responsible for introducing humans to forbidden knowledge, as described in the Book of Enoch. His role as a fallen angel partly remains in Christian and Islamic traditions. Bible. Torah. In the Hebrew Bible, the term is used three times in the Book of Leviticus, where two male goats were to be sacrificed to Yahweh and one of the two was selected by lot, for Yahweh is seen as speaking through the lots. One goat is selected by lot and sent into the wilderness , \"for Azazel\". This goat was then cast out in the desert as part of Yom Kippur. The scapegoat ritual can be traced back to 24th century BC Ebla, from where it spread throughout the ancient Near East.", "In older English versions, such as the King James Version, the phrase \"la-azazel\" is translated as \"as a scapegoat\"; however, in most modern English Bible translations, it is represented as a name in the text:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house. He shall take the two goats and set them before the Lord at the entrance of the tent of meeting; and Aaron shall cast lots on the two goats, one lot for the Lord and the other lot for Azazel. Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the Lord, and offer it as a sin offering; but the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive before the Lord to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to Azazel. A baraita, apparently interpreting \"ʿazazel\" as \"ʿaz\" (rugged) + \"El\" (God), understands it to refer to the rugged and rough mountain cliff from which the goat was cast down.

However, neither this demon nor the root are attested. In the Septuagint and later translations.", "\"Angel\" was one of the first songs written for \"Surfacing\". Sarah McLachlan said that writing it was easy, \"a real joyous occasion\", and that \"the bulk of it came in about three hours\". It was inspired by articles that she read in \"Rolling Stone\" about musicians turning to heroin to cope with the pressures of the music industry and subsequently overdosing, most notably Jonathan Melvoin, a keyboardist for the Smashing Pumpkins, who died of an overdose in 1996. She said that she identified with the feelings that might lead someone to use heroin: \"I've been in that place where you've messed up and you're so lost that you don't know who you are anymore, and you're miserable—and here's this escape route. I've never done heroin, but I've done plenty of other things to escape.\" She said that the song is about \"trying not to take responsibility for other people's problems and trying to love yourself at the same time\". Composition. The song has a sparse arrangement, with only three instruments used: a piano played by McLachlan, a drum machine programmed by Pierre Marchand, and upright bass played by Jim Creeggan of Barenaked Ladies. It was recorded in the key of D-flat major. For live performances, it is transposed up one half-step to D major, the key it was originally written in, and played without the bass.

Chichén Itzá is one of the most visited archeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in 2017. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nName and orthography. The Maya name \"Chichen Itza\" means \"At the mouth of the well of the Itza.\" This derives from \"chi\"', meaning \"mouth\" or \"edge\", and \"chʼen\" or \"chʼeʼen\", meaning \"well\". \"Itzá\" is the name of an ethnic-lineage group that gained political and economic dominance of the northern peninsula. One possible translation for Itza is \"enchanter (or enchantment) of the water,\" from \"its\" (itz), \"sorcerer\", and \"ha\", \"water\". The name is spelled \"Chichén Itzá\" in Spanish, and the accents are sometimes maintained in other languages to show that both parts of the name are stressed on their final syllable. Other references prefer the modern Maya orthography, \"Chichʼen Itzaʼ\" (pronounced ). This form preserves the phonemic distinction between \"chʼ\" and \"ch\", since the base word \"chʼeʼen\" (which, however, is not stressed in Maya) begins with a postalveolar ejective affricate consonant.", "The current belief trend in Maya scholarship is toward the more traditional model of the Maya kingdoms of the Classic Period southern lowlands in Mexico. Economy. Chichén Itzá was a major economic power in the northern Maya lowlands during its apogee. Participating in the water-borne circum-peninsular trade route through its port site of Isla Cerritos on the north coast, Chichen Itza was able to obtain locally unavailable resources from distant areas such as obsidian from central Mexico and gold from southern Central America. Between AD 900 and 1050 Chichén Itzá expanded to become a powerful regional capital controlling north and central Yucatán. It established Isla Cerritos as a trading port. History. The layout of Chichén Itzá site core developed during its earlier phase of occupation, between 750 and 900 AD. Its final layout was developed after 900 AD, and the 10th century saw the rise of the city as a regional capital controlling the area from central Yucatán to the north coast, with its power extending down the east and west coasts of the peninsula. The earliest hieroglyphic date discovered at Chichen Itza is equivalent to 832 AD, while the last known date was recorded in the Osario temple in 998. Establishment. The Late Classic city was centered upon the area to the southwest of the Xtoloc cenote, with the main architecture represented by the substructures now underlying the Las Monjas and Observatorio and the basal platform upon which they were built. Ascendancy. Chichén Itzá rose to regional prominence toward the end of the Early Classic period (roughly 600 AD).", "Pre-Columbian Maya city in Mexico\nChichén Itzá (often spelled \"Chichen Itza\" in English and traditional Yucatec Maya) was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico. Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion. Chichén Itzá was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or \"Tollans\", referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site. The ruins of Chichén Itzá are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History).", "Traditional Yucatec Maya spelling in Latin letters, used from the 16th through mid 20th century, spelled it as \"Chichen Itza\" (as accents on the last syllable are usual for the language, they are not indicated as they are in Spanish). The word \"Itzaʼ\" has a high tone on the \"a\" followed by a glottal stop (indicated by the apostrophe). Evidence in the Chilam Balam books indicates another, earlier name for this city prior to the arrival of the Itza hegemony in northern Yucatán. While most sources agree the first word means seven, there is considerable debate as to the correct translation of the rest. This earlier name is difficult to define because of the absence of a single standard of orthography, but it is represented variously as \"Uuc Yabnal\" (\"Seven Great House\"), \"Uuc Hab Nal\" (\"Seven Bushy Places\"), \"Uucyabnal\" (\"Seven Great Rulers\") or \"Uc Abnal\" (\"Seven Lines of Abnal\"). This name, dating to the Late Classic Period, is recorded both in the book of Chilam Balam de Chumayel and in hieroglyphic texts in the ruins. Location. Chichén Itzá is located in the eastern portion of Yucatán state in Mexico. The northern Yucatán Peninsula is karst, and the rivers in the interior all run underground.", "There are four visible, natural sink holes, called cenotes, that could have provided plentiful water year round at Chichen, making it attractive for settlement. Of these cenotes, the \"Cenote Sagrado\" or \"Sacred Cenote\" (also variously known as the Sacred Well or Well of Sacrifice), is the most famous. In 2015, scientists determined that there is a hidden cenote under the Temple of Kukulkan, which has never been seen by archeologists. According to post-Conquest sources (Maya and Spanish), pre-Columbian Maya sacrificed objects and human beings into the cenote as a form of worship to the Maya rain god Chaac. Edward Herbert Thompson dredged the Cenote Sagrado from 1904 to 1910, and recovered artifacts of gold, jade, pottery and incense, as well as human remains. A study of human remains taken from the Cenote Sagrado found that they had wounds consistent with human sacrifice. Political organization. Several archeologists in the late 1980s suggested that unlike previous Maya polities of the Early Classic, Chichén Itzá may not have been governed by an individual ruler or a single dynastic lineage. Instead, the city's political organization could have been structured by a \"multepal\" system, which is characterized as rulership through council composed of members of elite ruling lineages. This theory was popular in the 1990s, but in recent years, the research that supported the concept of the \"multepal\" system has been called into question, if not discredited."], "distances": [0.28567296266555786, 0.3133033514022827, 0.3457196354866028, 0.48922479152679443, 0.6560373306274414], "supports": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], "metadatas": [{"doc_name": "Chichen Itza", "pool_index": 1331, "mapped_id": "0365f13f-76bd-4691-8b18-a72eafa2426c", "support": 0}, {"pool_index": 1334, "support": 0, "mapped_id": "0365f13f-76bd-4691-8b18-a72eafa2426c", "doc_name": "Chichen Itza"}, {"doc_name": "Chichen Itza", "pool_index": 1330, "support": 1, "mapped_id": "0365f13f-76bd-4691-8b18-a72eafa2426c"}, {"mapped_id": "0365f13f-76bd-4691-8b18-a72eafa2426c", "doc_name": "Chichen Itza", "support": 0, "pool_index": 1332}, {"support": 0, "mapped_id": "0365f13f-76bd-4691-8b18-a72eafa2426c", "pool_index": 1333, "doc_name": "Chichen Itza"}], "recall": 1.0, "precision": 0.2, "ndcg": 0.5, "mrr": 0.3333333333333333}

The film was largely derided by critics upon its release but became a sleeper hit in the spring of 1996, grossing $20 million at the U.S. box office. It has since become a cult film, while at the same time launching teen idol status for its two young leads – Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon – who were romantically linked at the time of the movie's premiere.

However, the video sketch was never aired. So when, in 1997, two bored school boys in Taunton, England, started lying face-down in public places to amuse themselves and baffle onlookers, they could not have known of Green's stunt. Gary Clarkson (then aged 15) and Christian Langdon (then aged 12) called it the \"lying down game\". As Clarkson puts it, \"It was just a really stupid, random thing to do.\" The Lying Down Game remained within Clarkson and Langdon's circle of friends until 2007, when their friend Daniel Hoppin created a Facebook page for their craze. As Hoppin says, \"We began a Facebook group to see who could get the craziest photo.\" The term \"planking\" was coined by Sam Weckert, Darcy McCann and Kym Berry of Adelaide, South Australia: \"Planking was a term myself and two other mates came up with in the summer of 2008\". Weckert created a Facebook fan page to share \"planking\" photos. After reports of the practice started appearing in the Australian media, it grew rapidly and the meme became a global phenomenon.

In the years following its explosion in popularity, several variations on planking have proliferated, some inspired by the fad, and others that have arisen independently. Controversies. The popularity of planking generated backlash. Some people disapproved of the more objectionable photos that had circulated, such as a girl planking with her head in a toilet or a woman planking on a stripper pole. Planking in dangerous places also resulted in many injuries and at least one death.

The palms of the hands are typically touching the sides of the body and the toes are typically touching the ground. Some players compete to find the most unusual and original location in which to play. The term planking refers to mimicking a wooden plank. Planking can include lying flat on a flat surface, or holding the body flat while it is supported in only some regions, with other parts of the body suspended. Many participants in planking have photographed the activity in unusual locations and have shared such pictures through social media. Planking gained popularity rapidly and eventually notoriety from early-mid 2011 before slowly phasing out in early 2012. History. A planking-like activity called \"face dancing\" by its participants was initiated in 1820 in Edmonds, Washington in the US by Scott Amy and Joel Marshall. The two high school age boys were walking in a park when they came upon a baseball game. They decided to lie face down in right field to see if anyone would react. The first video-recorded occurrence of planking was in 1994 when Tom Green performed a stunt he called \"Dead Guy\" for a cable TV show, which consisted of Green lying down on an Ottawa sidewalk without moving. Green, who was in an MTV show in the 1990s, is a comedian known for his pranks. He informed CNN about this video evidence and how it did not air on the show, stating that it was \"a very obscure piece of video.\"", "Unexpected disappearances plagued the modern-day population, their fates sealed within the gaping maw of the portal.
