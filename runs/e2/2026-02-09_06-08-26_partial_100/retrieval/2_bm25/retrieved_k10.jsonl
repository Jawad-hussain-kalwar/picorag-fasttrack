He argues that Sellers is a mob lawyer, and Gloria was carrying an envelope holding $200,000 thousand in cash and had Sellers’ picture in her wallet. Knowing Sellers is one of Nicole’s clients, a reluctant Gaines agrees. Meanwhile, Marty collects Gloria’s things from Gloria’s roommate, Peggy Summers, who shows him a much larger photograph of Gloria and Sellers. Learning Gloria was a stripper who dated Herbie Dalitz, the emcee at her club, Marty goes to confront Herbie. That night, Gaines confesses he is having trouble accepting Nicole’s profession.

Tarzan is assisted by Captain Sam Bishop (Jan Murray), a riverboat pilot, and Bishop's young ward, Pepe (Manuel Padilla Jr.), as well as Baron (a lion) and Cheeta (a chimpanzee). On their way they encounter Dr. Ann Philips (Diana Millay), who has witnessed the destruction of a village, and wants to continue fighting a plague by giving much-needed inoculations to natives who live along the Amazon River.

Invited to visit Tarzan's African estate, they become lost in the jungle and are imprisoned by cannibals, from whom they escape. They are then reunited with their host, who introduces them to his pet lion, Jad-bal-ja. Subsequently, they become involved in an adventure involving exiles from the lost city of Opar, who have kidnapped Gretchen von Harben, the daughter of a missionary. The brutish Oparians, adherents of the deposed and deceased high priest Cadj, are seeking a place to continue worship of the Flaming God in the traditional way, as Opar's Queen La has outlawed human sacrifice in the lost city. They plan to make their young captive Gretchen, whom they dub \"Kla\", meaning \"New La\", their new high priestess. She is eventually rescued by Tarzan and the twins, while Glum, leader of the exiles, and some of his adherents are killed. Tarzan orders the survivors to return to Opar and be loyal to La.

According to ITIL, SAM is defined as “…all of the infrastructure and processes necessary for the effective management, control, and protection of the software assets…throughout all stages of their lifecycle.” \nFundamentally intended to be part of an organization's information technology business strategy, the goals of SAM are to reduce information technology (IT) costs and limit business and legal risk related to the ownership and use of software, while maximizing IT responsiveness and end-user productivity. SAM is particularly important for large corporations regarding redistribution of licenses and managing legal risks associated with software ownership and expiration. SAM technologies track license expiration, thus allowing the company to function ethically and within software compliance regulations. This can be important for both eliminating legal costs associated with license agreement violations and as part of a company's reputation management strategy. Both are important forms of risk management and are critical for large corporations' long-term business strategies. SAM is one facet of a broader business discipline known as IT asset management, which includes overseeing both software and hardware that comprise an organization's computers and network. Role within organizations. SAM can serve many different functions within organizations, depending on their software portfolios, IT infrastructures, resource availability, and business goals. For many organizations, the goal of implementing a SAM program is very tactical, explicitly focused on balancing the number of software licenses purchased with the number of actual licenses consumed or used.", "In addition to balancing the number of licenses purchased with the amount of consumption, an effective SAM program must also ensure that the usage of all installed software is in keeping with the terms and conditions of the specific vendor license agreement. In doing so, organizations can minimize liabilities associated with software piracy in the event of an audit by a software vendor or a third party such as the Business Software Alliance (BSA). SAM, according to this interpretation, involves conducting detailed software inventories on an ongoing basis to determine the exact number of software licenses consumed, comparing this information with the number of licenses purchased, and reviewing how the software is being used in respect to the terms and conditions and establishing controls to ensure that proper licensing practices are maintained on an ongoing basis. This can be accomplished through IT processes, purchasing policies and procedures, and technology solutions such as software inventory tools. Counting installations are the most common means of measuring license consumption but some software is licensed by the number of users, capital, processors, or CPU Cores. More broadly defined, the strategic goals of SAM often include (but are not limited to) the following: \nSAM Technology. Several technologies are available to support key SAM processes:\nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO). The ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards are designed to help organizations manage IT assets including software assets (SAM).

ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015: Software identification tag; establishes specifications for tagging software to optimize its identification and management. The current version was published in 2015 and is a revision to the 2009 original Software ID Tag standard. Using software identification tags or SWID tags makes discovery a simpler and more accurate process that can be verified by software vendors if they audit an organisations entire estate. SWID tags are implemented and supported by many vendors including IBM, Microsoft and Adobe.

Total return swaps are an example of an off-balance-sheet item. Some companies may have significant amounts of off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities. For example, financial institutions often offer asset management or brokerage services to their clients. The assets managed or brokered as part of these offered services (often securities) usually belong to the individual clients directly or in trust, although the company provides management, depository or other services to the client. The company itself has no direct claim to the assets, so it does not record them on its balance sheet (they are off-balance-sheet assets), while it usually has some basic fiduciary duties with respect to the client. Financial institutions may report off-balance-sheet items in their accounting statements formally, and may also refer to \"assets under management\", a figure that may include on- and off-balance-sheet items. Under previous accounting rules both in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and internationally (IFRS), operating leases were off-balance-sheet financing. Under current accounting rules (ASC 842, IFRS 16), operating leases are on the balance sheet.

The formal accounting distinction between on- and off-balance-sheet items can be quite detailed and will depend to some degree on management judgments, but in general terms, an item should appear on the company's balance sheet if it is an asset or liability that the company owns or is legally responsible for; uncertain assets or liabilities must also meet tests of being \"probable\", \"measurable\" and \"meaningful\". For example, a company that is being sued for damages would not include the potential legal liability on its balance sheet until a legal judgment against it is likely and the amount of the judgment can be estimated; if the amount at risk is small, it may not appear on the company's accounts until a judgment is rendered. Differences between on and off balance sheets. Traditionally, banks lend to borrowers under tight lending standards, keep loans on their balance sheets and retain credit risk—the risk that borrowers will default (be unable to repay interest and principal as specified in the loan contract). In contrast, securitization enables banks to remove loans from balance sheets and transfer the credit risk associated with those loans. Therefore, two types of items are of interest: on balance sheet and off balance sheet. The former is represented by traditional loans, since banks indicate loans on the asset side of their balance sheets. However, securitized loans are represented off the balance sheet, because securitization involves selling the loans to a third party (the loan originator and the borrower being the first two parties).", "In late 2012, Symantec released version 12.1.2, which supports VMware vShield.

The word is derived from Mithridates VI, the king of Pontus, who so feared being poisoned that he regularly ingested small doses, aiming to develop immunity. Background. Mithridates VI's father, Mithridates V, was assassinated by poisoning by a conspiracy among his attendants. After this, Mithridates VI's mother held regency over Pontus (a Hellenistic kingdom, 281 BC–62 AD) until a male heir came of age. Mithridates was in competition with his brother for the throne and his mother began to favor his brother. Supposedly, during his youth, he began to suspect plots against him at his own mother's orders and was aware of her possible connection with his father's death. He then began to notice pains in his stomach during his meals and suspected his mother had ordered small amounts of poison to be added to his food to slowly kill him off. With other assassination attempts, he fled into the wild. While in the wild, it is said that he began ingesting non-lethal amounts of poisons and mixing many into a universal remedy to make him immune to all known poisons. After Mithridates' death, many Roman physicians claimed to possess and improve the formula.

Diminutive forms in Slavic languages include Ira, Irinka, Irinushka, Irinochka, Irisha, Irka, Irochka, Irusia, Iraya. Origin. Irina is connected with Irene of Macedonia who was the first woman recognized by the church as a great martyr. She was born pagan as Penelope and later baptized as Irene. Some sources refer to her being baptized by Saint Timothy, in which case she lived in the 1st–2nd century, while others date her death in the year 315.

Indian epics talk about this practice as well. It has been said that, during the rule of the king Chandragupta Maurya (320–298 BC), there was a practice of selecting beautiful girls and administering poison in small amounts until they grew up, thus making them insensitive to poison. These maidens were called \"vishakanyas\" (visha 'poison' + kanya 'maiden'). It was believed that making love with vishakanyas could result in the death of their partners, hence they were employed to kill enemies. The emperor Bindusara was the son of the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya and his queen Durdhara. According to the \"Rajavalikatha\", a Jain work, the original name of this emperor was Simhasena. A legend mentioned in the Jain texts tells the story of how Chandragupta's Guru and advisor Chanakya used to feed the emperor with small doses of poison to build his immunity against possible poisoning attempts by his enemies. One day, Chandragupta, unaware that his food contained poison, shared his food with his pregnant wife, Queen Durdhara, who was seven days away from delivery.

Historically, it is attested on cuneiform tablets from Mesopotamia, in ancient Egyptian texts and later Coptic texts, in the Greco-Roman world, in Syriac texts, in the European Middle Ages and early modern period, and among all Jewish groups who co-existed with these groups. The exact definition of what constitutes 'love magic' can be difficult to establish and will vary from scholar to scholar, but a common theme shared by many is the use of magic to start, preserve, or break up a relationship of some type whether for purely sexual or romantic purposes or both. The tools and methods used in its practice do not significantly differ from the way other forms of magic are practiced and include spoken and written spells and incantations, dolls, talismans, amulets, potions, and rituals. As most surviving sources concern love between men and women, there is a strong heterosexual bias when discussing these sources, though there are a few examples known to concern love between both two men and two women, such as Greek curse tablets. Love magic motifs appear in literature and art and in the mythologies of many cultures.

The holotype skeleton is only missing the last section of the tail and part of the front legs, but was preserved with impressions of polygonal scales. \"Corythosaurus\" is known from many skulls with tall crests that resemble those of the cassowary and a Corinthian helmet. The most likely function of the crest is thought to be vocalization. As in a trombone, sound waves would travel through many chambers in the crest and then get amplified when \"Corythosaurus\" exhaled. One \"Corythosaurus\" specimen has even been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity.", "In the modern era, the concept of branding has expanded to include deployment by a manager of the marketing and communication techniques and tools that help to distinguish a company or products from competitors, aiming to create a lasting impression in the minds of customers. The key components that form a brand's toolbox include a brand's identity, personality, product design, brand communication (such as by logos and trademarks), brand awareness, brand loyalty, and various branding (brand management) strategies. Many companies believe that there is often little to differentiate between several types of products in the 21st century, hence branding is among a few remaining forms of product differentiation. Brand equity is the measurable totality of a brand's worth and is validated by observing the effectiveness of these branding components. When a customer is familiar with a brand or favors it incomparably over its competitors, a corporation has reached a high level of brand equity. Brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value. Brand valuation is a management technique that ascribes a monetary value to a brand. Etymology. The word \"brand\", originally meaning a burning piece of wood, comes from a Middle English \"brand\", meaning \"torch\", from an Old English \"brand\". It became to also mean the mark from burning with a branding iron. History. Branding and labeling have an ancient history. Branding probably began with the practice of branding livestock to deter theft. Images of the branding of cattle occur in ancient Egyptian tombs dating to around 2,700 BCE.", "Identification for a good or service\nA brand is a name, term, design, symbol or any other feature that distinguishes one seller's good or service from those of other sellers. Brands are used in business, marketing, and advertising for recognition and, importantly, to create and store value as brand equity for the object identified, to the benefit of the brand's customers, its owners and shareholders. Brand names are sometimes distinguished from generic or store brands. The practice of branding—in the original literal sense of marking by burning—is thought to have begun with the ancient Egyptians, who are known to have engaged in livestock branding and branded slaves as early as 2,700 BCE. Branding was used to differentiate one person's cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal's skin with a hot branding iron. If a person stole any of the cattle, anyone else who saw the symbol could deduce the actual owner. The term has been extended to mean a strategic personality for a product or company, so that \"brand\" now suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into. Over time, the practice of branding objects extended to a broader range of packaging and goods offered for sale including oil, wine, cosmetics, and fish sauce and, in the 21st century, extends even further into services (such as legal, financial and medical), political parties and people's stage names.", "Németh is a Hungarian surname.

He was just in time; a drop of poison had already reached the baby and touched his head, leaving a permanent blueish spot (a \"bindu\") on his forehead. Thus, the newborn was named \"Bindusara\". In practice. Mithridatism is not effective against all types of poison. Immunity is generally only possible with biologically complex types which the immune system can respond to. Depending on the toxin, the practice can lead to the lethal accumulation of a poison in the body. Results depend on how each poison is processed by the body, i.e. on how the toxic compound is metabolized or passed out of the body. However, in some cases, it is possible to build up a metabolic tolerance against specific non-biological poisons. This involves conditioning the liver to produce more of the particular enzymes that metabolize these poisons. For example, heavy drinkers develop a tolerance to the effects of alcohol. However, metabolic tolerance can also lead to accumulation of the less toxic metabolized compound which can slowly damage the liver. With alcohol this generally leads to conditions such as alcoholic fatty liver disease. Metabolic tolerance is not effective on all types of non-biological poisons. Exposure to certain toxic substances, such as hydrofluoric acid and heavy metals, is either lethal or has little to no effect. A minor exception is cyanide, which can be metabolized by the liver."], "distances": [46.999213677966175, 37.091552040618865, 36.51001043933825, 34.941477724362606, 34.86497413506858, 34.13849742560693, 33.41996703165912, 33.142110574528736, 32.40484478860118, 32.30940257073403], "supports": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "metadatas": [{"mapped_id": "0066d36e-f0e8-4cbb-a302-4c4d0b0498f2", "doc_name": "Mithridatism", "support": 1, "pool_index": 1250}, {"mapped_id": "0ab1a8c8-d19d-4990-b681-b0432d26a069", "doc_name": "Irina", "support": 0, "pool_index": 821}, {"mapped_id": "0066d36e-f0e8-4cbb-a302-4c4d0b0498f2", "doc_name": "Mithridatism", "support": 0, "pool_index": 1251}, {"mapped_id": "031092bf-c551-4b0e-9ff1-1b75996cf8d9", "doc_name": "Noto", "support": 0, "pool_index": 817}, {"mapped_id": "0de02215-f275-4d6e-a034-1ff7a3b74a13", "doc_name": "Love magic", "support": 0, "pool_index": 161}, {"mapped_id": "01fd9228-b964-461c-87b6-930557569010", "doc_name": "Corythosaurus", "support": 0, "pool_index": 1080}, {"mapped_id": "076f3925-a948-4d93-a516-1febeed37cb3", "doc_name": "Brand", "support": 0, "pool_index": 93}, {"mapped_id": "076f3925-a948-4d93-a516-1febeed37cb3", "doc_name": "Brand", "support": 0, "pool_index": 92}, {"mapped_id": "0958d079-fb71-4b6d-b193-a41d6f8fadf9", "doc_name": "Németh", "support": 0, "pool_index": 103}, {"mapped_id": "0066d36e-f0e8-4cbb-a302-4c4d0b0498f2", "doc_name": "Mithridatism", "support": 0, "pool_index": 1252}], "recall": 1.0, "precision": 0.1, "ndcg": 1.0, "mrr": 1.0}

The main characters of female buddy films are women, and the film's events center on their situations. The main cast is often female, depending on the plot. Critic Hannah McGill of \"Sight &amp; Sound\" wrote, \"Films that centralise friendship between women and girls are thus always doing something slightly radical, whatever their other themes and content.

He stole from the rich and gave to the poor. According to legend, he was a highly skilled archer and swordsman. In some versions of the legend, he is depicted as being of noble birth, and in modern retellings he is sometimes depicted as having fought in the Crusades before returning to England to find his lands taken by the Sheriff. In the oldest known versions, he is instead a member of the yeoman class. He is traditionally depicted dressed in Lincoln green. Through retellings, additions, and variations, a body of familiar characters associated with Robin Hood has been created. These include his lover, Maid Marian; his band of outlaws, the Merry Men; and his chief opponent, the Sheriff of Nottingham. The Sheriff is often depicted as assisting Prince John in usurping the rightful but absent King Richard, to whom Robin Hood remains loyal. He became a popular folk figure in the Late Middle Ages, and his partisanship of the common people and opposition to the Sheriff are some of the earliest-recorded features of the legend, whereas his political interests and setting during the Angevin era developed in later centuries. The earliest known ballads featuring him are from the 15th century. There have been numerous variations and adaptations of the story over the subsequent years, and the story continues to be widely represented in literature, film, and television media today. Robin Hood is considered one of the best-known tales of English folklore.", "In popular culture, the term \"Robin Hood\" is often used to describe a heroic outlaw or rebel against tyranny. The origins of the legend as well as the historical context have been debated for centuries. There are numerous references to historical figures with similar names that have been proposed as possible evidence of his existence, some dating back to the late 13th century. At least eight plausible origins to the story have been mooted by historians and folklorists, including suggestions that \"Robin Hood\" was a stock alias used by or in reference to bandits. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBallads and tales. The first clear reference to \"rhymes of Robin Hood\" is from the alliterative poem \"Piers Plowman\", thought to have been composed in the 1370s, followed shortly afterwards by a quotation of a later common proverb, \"many men speak of Robin Hood and never shot his bow\", in \"Friar Daw's Reply\" (c. 1402) and a complaint in \"Dives and Pauper\" (1405–1410) that people would rather listen to \"tales and songs of Robin Hood\" than attend Mass. Robin Hood is also mentioned in a famous Lollard tract dated to the first half of the fifteenth century (thus also possibly predating his other earliest historical mentions) alongside several other folk heroes such as Guy of Warwick, Bevis of Hampton, and Sir Lybeaus.", "The earliest surviving text of a Robin Hood ballad is the 15th-century \"Robin Hood and the Monk\". This is preserved in Cambridge University manuscript Ff.5.48. Written after 1450, it contains many of the elements still associated with the legend, from the Nottingham setting to the bitter enmity between Robin and the local sheriff. The first printed version is \"A Gest of Robyn Hode\" (c. 1500), a collection of separate stories that attempts to unite the episodes into a single continuous narrative. After this comes \"Robin Hood and the Potter\", contained in a manuscript of c. 1503. \"The Potter\" is markedly different in tone from \"The Monk\": whereas the earlier tale is \"a thriller\" the latter is more comic, its plot involving trickery and cunning rather than straightforward force. Other early texts are dramatic pieces, the earliest being the fragmentary \"Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham\" (c. 1475). These are particularly noteworthy as they show Robin's integration into May Day rituals towards the end of the Middle Ages; \"Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham\", among other points of interest, contains the earliest reference to Friar Tuck. The plots of neither \"the Monk\" nor \"the Potter\" are included in the \"Gest\"; and neither is the plot of \"Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne\", which is probably at least as old as those two ballads although preserved in a more recent copy.", "However, the earliest surviving copies of the narrative ballads that tell his story date to the second half of the 15th century, or the first decade of the 16th century. In these early accounts, Robin Hood's partisanship of the lower classes, his devotion to the Virgin Mary and associated special regard for women, his outstanding skill as an archer, his anti-clericalism, and his particular animosity towards the Sheriff of Nottingham are already clear. Little John, Much the Miller's Son, and Will Scarlet (as Will \"Scarlok\" or \"Scathelocke\") all appear, although not yet Maid Marian or Friar Tuck. The friar has been part of the legend since at least the later 15th century, when he is mentioned in a Robin Hood play script. In modern popular culture, Robin Hood is typically seen as a contemporary and supporter of the late-12th-century king Richard the Lionheart, Robin being driven to outlawry during the misrule of Richard's brother John while Richard was away at the Third Crusade. This view first gained currency in the 16th century. It is not supported by the earliest ballads. The early compilation, \"A Gest of Robyn Hode\", names the king as 'Edward'; and while it does show Robin Hood accepting the King's pardon, he later repudiates it and returns to the greenwood. The oldest surviving ballad, \"Robin Hood and the Monk\", gives even less support to the picture of Robin Hood as a partisan of the true king.", "The setting of the early ballads is usually attributed by scholars to either the 13th century or the 14th, although it is recognised they are not necessarily historically consistent. The early ballads are also quite clear on Robin Hood's social status: he is a yeoman. While the precise meaning of this term changed over time, including free retainers of an aristocrat and small landholders, it always referred to commoners. The essence of it in the present context was \"neither a knight nor a peasant or 'husbonde' but something in between\". Artisans (such as millers) were among those regarded as 'yeomen' in the 14th century. From the 16th century on, there were attempts to elevate Robin Hood to the nobility, such as in Richard Grafton's \"Chronicle at Large\"; Anthony Munday presented him at the very end of the century as the Earl of Huntingdon in two extremely influential plays, as he is still commonly presented in modern times. As well as ballads, the legend was also transmitted by 'Robin Hood games' or plays that were an important part of the late medieval and early modern May Day festivities. The first record of a Robin Hood game was in 1426 in Exeter, but the reference does not indicate how old or widespread this custom was at the time. The Robin Hood games are known to have flourished in the later 15th and 16th centuries. It is commonly stated as fact that Maid Marian and a jolly friar (at least partly identifiable with Friar Tuck) entered the legend through the May Games.

The original title of the novel was \"The Cheated\". The title of West's work may be a biblical allusion to the Old Testament. Susan Sanderson writes: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The most famous literary or historical reference to locusts is in the Book of Exodus in the Bible, in which God sends a plague of locusts to the pharaoh of Egypt as retribution for refusing to free the enslaved Jews. Millions of locusts swarm over the lush fields of Egypt, destroying its food supplies. Destructive locusts also appear in the New Testament in the symbolic and apocalyptic book of Revelation. West's use of \"locust\" in his title evokes images of destruction and a land stripped bare of anything green and living. The novel is filled with images of destruction: Tod Hackett's painting entitled \"The Burning of Los Angeles,\" his violent fantasies about Faye and the bloody result of the cockfight. A close examination of West's characters and his selective use of natural images, which include representations of violence and impotence — and which are therefore contrary to popular images linking nature and fertility — reveals that the locust in the title is Tod.

Already under construction when the Battle of Jutland occurred in mid-1916, that battle revealed serious flaws in her design, and despite drastic revisions she was completed four years later. For this reason, she was the only ship of her class to be completed, as the Admiralty decided it would be better to start with a clean design on succeeding battlecruisers, leading to the never-built G-3 class. Despite the appearance of newer and more modern ships, \"Hood\" remained the largest warship in the world for 20 years after her commissioning, and her prestige was reflected in her nickname, \"The Mighty Hood\". \"Hood\" was involved in many showing-the-flag exercises between her commissioning in 1920 and the outbreak of war in 1939, including training exercises in the Mediterranean Sea and a circumnavigation of the globe with the Special Service Squadron in 1923 and 1924. She was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet following the outbreak of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935. When the Spanish Civil War broke out the following year, \"Hood\" was officially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet until she had to return to Britain in 1939 for an overhaul.

The tree-in-bud sign is a nonspecific imaging finding that implies impaction within bronchioles, the smallest airway passages in the lung.

This includes fungal infections, mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis or mycobacterium avium intracellulare, bronchopneumonia, chronic aspiration pneumonia, cystic fibrosis or cellular impaction from bronchovascular spread of malignancy, as can occur with breast cancer, leukemia or lymphoma. It also includes lung manifestations of autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren syndrome or rheumatoid arthritis. Histopathologic studies have shown that the tree-in-bud pattern is caused by demarcation of the normally invisible branching course of the peripheral airways, which usually results from bronchioles being plugged or blocked with mucus, pus or fluid.

Gram panchayats.", "Immature or embryonic shoot\nIn botany, a bud is an undeveloped or embryonic shoot and normally occurs in the axil of a leaf or at the tip of a stem. Once formed, a bud may remain for some time in a dormant condition, or it may form a shoot immediately. Buds may be specialized to develop flowers or short shoots or may have the potential for general shoot development. The term bud is also used in zoology, where it refers to an outgrowth from the body which can develop into a new individual. Overview. The buds of many woody plants, especially in temperate or cold climates, are protected by a covering of modified leaves called \"scales\" which tightly enclose the more delicate parts of the bud. Many bud scales are covered by a gummy substance which serves as added protection. When the bud develops, the scales may enlarge somewhat but usually just drop off, leaving a series of horizontally-elongated scars on the surface of the growing stem. By means of these scars one can determine the age of any young branch, since each year's growth ends in the formation of a bud, the formation of which produces an additional group of bud scale scars. Continued growth of the branch causes these scars to be obliterated after a few years so that the total age of older branches cannot be determined by this means. In many plants, scales do not form over the bud, and the bud is then called a naked bud. The minute underdeveloped leaves in such buds are often excessively hairy.", "The incidence of LASH increases with older age and obesity.

Powell, Clarke and Michelot, under the name The Three Bosses, had played together often in Paris since Powell moved there in 1959. The album was remastered by Rudy Van Gelder in 2003 and released as part of Blue Note's RVG Edition series. Music. The original intention was for the pianist on the recording to be Kenny Drew and for the music to be new compositions by Gordon. However, the actual pianist used was Bud Powell, who would not play new music, so jazz standards were chosen during the rehearsal. The two tracks added to the CD release were originally issued by Blue Note on Bud Powell's \"Alternate Takes\" in 1985.

The flowers occur in terminal spike-like inflorescences up to 20 cm long. Light green in color, these flowers are very conspicuous in the spring. Each pistillate (female) flower is solitary and has a three-lobed ovary, three styles, and no petals. They are located on short branches at the base of the spike. The staminate (male) flowers occur in clusters at the upper nodes of the inflorescence. Fruits are three-lobed, three-valved capsules. As the capsules mature, their color changes from green to a brown-black.", "Tallow trees present a danger of expansion that can hurt local ecosystems by out-competing native vegetation and creating a monoculture. The monoculture lowers species diversity and overall resilience of the area. The tree's tenacious nature, high growth rates, and high reproductive ability contribute to its invasive success. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, tallow trees begin producing viable seed in as soon as three years. They can spread by root sprouts and cuttings and are quick to invade after a disturbance occurs in an area, due to the clearing out of land. A single tallow tree can produce nearly 100,000 viable seeds annually that can remain in the soil for several years before sprouting. A mature stand can produce 4,500 kilograms of seeds per hectare per year. These seeds are easily carried to different places by birds and water. Tallow trees can remain productive for 100 years. It is also extremely hard to kill—its poisonous features in its leaves and berries leave it with few to no predators, and its short generation time means even freshly cut trees can quickly regrow. Currently, herbicides and prescribed fire are the only effective treatments available to contain and control Chinese tallow. The USDA is evaluating the flea beetle (\"Bikasha collaris\") as a natural control agent. In the Houston area, Chinese tallow trees account for a full 23 percent of all trees, more than any other tree species and is the only invasive tree species in the 14 most common species in the area.", "Gram panchayats under Galsi I Panchayat Samiti (in Bardhaman Sadar North subdivision) are: Chaktentul, Budbud, Mankar, Lowapur-Krishnarampur, Serorai and Uchagram.

The success of that act gained Prima a recording deal with Capitol Records, which aimed to capture on record the atmosphere of his shows. The first album, titled \"The Wildest!\" and released in November 1956, opened with \"Just a Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody\", which then became Prima's signature number and helped relaunch his career. Butera is noted for his raucous playing style, his off-color humor, and the innuendo in his lyrics.

He was dissatisfied with the result and it was too short, so he suggested they all drink wine and urinate in the bath at the same time. Upon completion, Wakeman accidentally flicked some marmalade onto the master tape as he was eating. This resulted in Tregurtha spending several hours carefully washing off around 300 feet of tape using soap and water without damaging it. Should the tape have become useless, Wakeman said they would have had to fly the band over and rerecord the parts. In a 2003 interview, Wakeman said he could hear any section of \"No Earthly Connection\" and recall what time of the day he put them to tape. During the recording, Wakeman found himself sitting on a wall crying in a village miles from the studio. \"I still don't know how I got there or why I was crying\" and added, \"It was as if my mind had blown a fuse\". He said his album \"Out There\" (2003) is, in many ways, a sequel to \"No Earthly Connection\". Music. \"No Earthly Connection\" marked a change in Wakeman's musical direction.

Luxury variants—the Holden Berlina and Holden Calais—and a utility version—the Holden Ute—were available. Succeeding the VZ series, the VE was the first iteration of the fourth generation of the Holden Commodore, a series of automobiles built between 1978 and 2020. Unlike its predecessors, which used Opel-sourced platforms adapted mechanically and in size for the local market, the VE was the first Commodore entirely designed and developed by Holden in Australia. Despite its status as an all-new model, engines—comprising the 3.6-litre V6 and the 6.0-litre V8—derive mainly from the VZ series. To minimise export redevelopment costs, features such as a symmetrical centre console housing a flush-fitting hand brake lever facilitated the conversion to left-hand drive. The VE was internationally badge-engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Omega, Bitter Vero Sport and Pontiac G8. Holden introduced the VE variants in stages, beginning with the sedan in July 2006. Before this, Holden stated they would manufacture two parallel generations of Commodores until the launch of the station wagon and utility. Variants by Holden's performance vehicle partner, Holden Special Vehicles, were released soon after the sedan's debut alongside the long-wheelbase WM Statesman/Caprice models. The VE Ute entered production in 2007, coinciding with the unveiling of the Sportwagon concept car.", "The production version of the Sportwagon—which shared its wheelbase with the sedan instead of the extended wheelbase from the Caprice like previous models—was introduced in July 2008. Holden introduced updates to the VE as model year changes starting in April 2007. Typically subtle, these recurring changes have involved alterations to colours and trim, increased standard equipment, and reduced fuel consumption. More noteworthy adjustments have come in the form of a smaller 3.0-litre V6 engine for entry-level versions and \"Series II\" styling revisions in September 2010. Development. Official manufacture of the VE sedan began at Holden's production facility in Elizabeth, South Australia, on 13 July 2006. Three days later, Holden debuted the car at the Melbourne Convention Centre, broadcast simultaneously via the Internet. Its debut occurred alongside that of the company's flagship model, the Statesman/Caprice (WM). Before this, Holden announced that the VE station wagon and utility variants would be delayed, while the VZ equivalents would continue to be produced. The VE Ute was revealed on 22 August 2007. This was followed by the unveiling of the Sportwagon concept late that year, the production version of which was released in July 2008. Sedan. In 1999 Holden's designers and engineers began laying down the basics of a clean-sheet Commodore sedan. In the seven years of development the car became Holden's largest and most expensive project, representing an expenditure of approximately A$1.03 billion and 3.4 million kilometres (2.1 million miles) of testing.", "In 2004, two years before the release of the VE Commodore, Holden unveiled the Torana TT36 concept car at the Australian International Motor Show in Sydney. This concept previewed the production Commodore and allowed Holden to assess public response to its exterior design. Some production-ready components such as the steering wheel and the handbrake lever were integrated from the TT36 into the production VE. After completing the initial design sketches Holden's engineers quickly began work on developing the chassis. Opel discontinued the rear-wheel drive Omega in 2003. Holden, who used this platform for all earlier Commodore models, had two options: adopt another GM platform or create a new architecture. GM's new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform, which was set to debut in the Cadillac CTS, was offered to Holden's engineers, but they believed that it was unsuitable for the car's requirements. The shoulder width in the rear seat was too narrow. Holden chose to develop a new platform, the GM Zeta, which would also serve as the basis for several upcoming GM vehicles. The car features a double-pivot MacPherson strut front suspension and a four-link independent rear suspension, replacing the earlier MacPherson strut front and semi-trailing arm rear designs. Denny Mooney was appointed chairman of Holden in January 2004. One of Mooney's priorities was to improve the perceived quality issues that surrounded the previous generations of Commodores. Mooney advocated for a reduction of panel gaps by an over previous targets.", "Using three-quarters high-strength steel and an intensive design, the body structure is 50 per cent stiffer than the outgoing model. Strength enhancements include the incorporation of tailor-welded blanks in the front chassis rails and floor reinforcing, resulting in a bare shell mass of . These advancements not only result in noise, vibration and harshness reductions but also lead to improved handling and crash safety. The development of the VE prompted Holden to redesign the facility in Elizabeth, South Australia, facilitating the assembly of entire sections of the car off the foremost production line. This production method allows for a seamless construction of complete sub-sections such as the engine and transmissions to be assembled on rigs that simplify production. This process is applied to the front-end module of the VE Commodore, comprising its headlights, bumpers, airbag sensors and other accessory components. This modular construction permits the easy removal of the entire front-end as a single-piece unit, resulting in reduced repair costs and easier access to the engine bay. This production technique was the first used by GM and won the SAE Australasia's 2006 \"Automotive Engineering Excellence Award\". A modular design structure known as the \"Flex\" strategy has been applied to the interior where fundamentally different components such as audio units and instrument clusters can be swapped out for the various Commodore variants, creating radically varied interior look and feel without much higher costs. The upshot of this is much greater differentiation between the variants than the outgoing model, creating three distinct interior looks, dubbed \"Functional\", \"Performance\" and \"Luxury\".", "Banks initially thought it would receive favorable reception from the labels, but the representatives informed Banks that she had not recorded a \"hit\" single for the album.

According to Bob Keeshan, Mr. Green Jeans was an extension of Brannum's real personality. During one episode of \"Captain Kangaroo\", a lion cub bit Brannum's finger and drew blood.

Four men, members of a Welsh rugby union club, fly to Paris as part of a weekend outing to see Wales play France in the Five Nations Championship match that will decide the Grand Slam title. One of the party is funeral director Caradog Lloyd-Evans (Griffith), who briefly served in occupied Paris near the end of World War II. Caradog pays for his son Glyn's air ticket on the proviso that Glyn (Morris) comes on a 'pilgrimage' to find his 'little butterfly' who he spent a short romantic period with during the war. This pilgrimage is successful and although the right place is found, it is no longer the innocent bistro of his youth but one of many strip club joints. Mr Lloyd-Evans mistakes a young girl in the club (who is a spitting image of his 'little butterfly') for the real thing and finds that the girl is actually Odette (Sharon Morgan), the daughter of his old flame.

Susan Sanderson writes: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The most famous literary or historical reference to locusts is in the Book of Exodus in the Bible, in which God sends a plague of locusts to the pharaoh of Egypt as retribution for refusing to free the enslaved Jews.

West's use of \"locust\" in his title evokes images of destruction and a land stripped bare of anything green and living. The novel is filled with images of destruction: Tod Hackett's painting entitled \"The Burning of Los Angeles,\" his violent fantasies about Faye and the bloody result of the cockfight. A close examination of West's characters and his selective use of natural images, which include representations of violence and impotence — and which are therefore contrary to popular images linking nature and fertility — reveals that the locust in the title is Tod.

The novel follows a young artist from the Yale School of Fine Arts named Tod Hackett, who has been hired by a Hollywood studio to do scene design and painting. While he works he plans an important painting to be called \"The Burning of Los Angeles\", a portrayal of the chaotic and fiery holocaust which will destroy the city. While the cast of characters Tod befriends are a conglomerate of Hollywood stereotypes, his greater discovery is a part of society whose \"eyes filled with hatred\", and \"had come to California to die\". This undercurrent of society captures the despair of Americans who worked and saved their entire lives only to realize, too late, that the American dream was more elusive than they imagine. Their anger boils into rage, and the craze over the latest Hollywood premiere erupts violently into mob rule and absolute chaos. In the introduction to \"The Day of the Locust\", Richard Gehman writes that the novel was \"more ambitious\" than West's previous novel \"Miss Lonelyhearts\", and \"showed marked progress in West's thinking and in his approach toward maturity as a writer.\" Gehman calls the novel \"episodic in structure, but panoramic in form\". Characters. Secondary characters. West's characters are intentionally shallow, stereotyped stock characters, and \"derive from all the B-grade genre films of the period\" (Simon, 523).", "They are what Light calls \"grotesques\". In the first chapter of the novel, the narrative voice announces: \"Yes, despite his appearance, Tod was really a very complicated young man with a whole set of personalities, one inside the other like a nest of Chinese boxes.\" Plot summary. Tod Hackett is the novel's protagonist. He moves from the East coast to Hollywood, California in search of inspiration for his next painting. The novel is set in the 1930s during the Great Depression. Most of the characters exist at the fringes of the Hollywood film industry, but Hollywood is merely the backdrop for Tod Hackett's revelation. Tod is employed by a Hollywood studio \"to learn set and costume designing.\" During his spare time, Tod sketches scenes he observes on large production sets and studio back lots. The novel details Tod's observation of the filming of the Battle of Waterloo. His goal is to find inspiration for the painting he is getting ready to begin, a work titled \"The Burning of Los Angeles.\" Tod falls in love with Faye Greener, an aspiring starlet who lives nearby but Faye only loves men who are good looking or wealthy. She is beautiful but lacks the acting talent to progress beyond roles as an extra. Tod is simply a \"good-hearted man,\" the kind Faye likes. He imagines that loving her would compare to jumping from a skyscraper and screaming to the ground. Tod wants to \"throw himself [at her], no matter what the cost.\" Throughout the novel, Tod fantasizes about having a sexual encounter with Faye as an act of rape.", "Tod vividly revises \"The Burning of Los Angeles\" in his mind, while being pushed around in the human waves of the riot. The final scene plays out, uninterrupted. The conclusion of the novel can be read as a moment of epiphany and mental clarity for the artist, or a complete \"mental breakdown\" and Tod's \"incorporation into the mechanized, modern world of Los Angeles.\" Themes. The characters are outcasts, who have come to Hollywood to fulfill a dream or wish:\n\"The importance of the wish in West's work was first noted by W. H. Auden, who declared (in one of the interludes in \"The Dyer's Hand\") that West's novels were essentially \"parables about a Kingdom of Hell whose ruler is not so much a Father of Lies as a Father of Wishes\". In this respect, James Light, in his book \"Violence, Dreams, and Dostoevsky: The Art of Nathanael West\", suggests that \"The Day of the Locust\" falls in with a motif in West's fiction; the exposure of hopeful narratives in modern American culture as frauds. As some critics point out, West's novel was a radical challenge to modernist literature. Some modernists set themselves up in opposition to mass culture; West depicts it and makes it an integral part of the novel. West's use of grotesque imagery and situations establishes the novel as a work of Juvenalian satire.", "1985 film by Martin Scorsese\nAfter Hours is a 1985 American black comedy film directed by Martin Scorsese, written by Joseph Minion, and produced by Amy Robinson, Griffin Dunne, and Robert F. Colesberry. Dunne stars as Paul Hackett, an office worker who experiences a series of misadventures while attempting to make his way home from Manhattan's SoHo district during the night. \"After Hours\" was critically acclaimed for its black humor, and is considered to be an underrated Scorsese film.

Marcy tells him that she is living in SoHo with a sculptor named Kiki Bridges, who makes and sells plaster-of-Paris paperweights resembling cream cheese bagels, and leaves him her number. Later in the night, after calling the number under the pretense of buying a paperweight, Paul takes a taxi to the apartment.

Between his work at the studio and his introduction to Faye's friends, Tod interacts with numerous Hollywood hangers-on. Characters like Abe Kusich, the dwarf; Claude Estee, the successful screenwriter; and Earle Shoop, the fake California cowboy, all of whom have difficulty changing their personas from the characters they play to who they are. As a result, there is a clear sense of acting and fakery that spills beyond the confines of Hollywood studios and into the streets of Los Angeles. Shortly after moving into a neighborhood in the valley, Tod befriends Homer Simpson, a simple-minded bookkeeper from Iowa who moved to California for health reasons. Homer Simpson's \"unruly hands\" operate independently from his body, and their movements are often mechanical. \"They demanded special attention, had always demanded it.\" When Homer attempts to escape California he is distracted not only by the crowd but his inability to leave the street despite Tod's help and insistent encouragement. A neighbor's son, the child actor Adore Loomis finds Homer and torments him until Homer violently lashes out against the boy.

Thousands of Mormon pioneers would arrive in Salt Lake in the coming months and years. Brigham Young led the Saints west after the death of Joseph Smith. Upon arrival to the Salt Lake valley, Young had a vision by saying, \"It is enough. This is the right place. Drive on.\" (This is commonly shortened to, \"This is the place\"). There is a state park in Salt Lake City known as This Is The Place Heritage Park commemorating the spot where Young made the famous statement. Settlers buried thirty-six Native Americans in one grave after an outbreak of measles occurred during the winter of 1847. Salt Lake City was originally settled by Latter-day Saint Pioneers to be the New Zion according to church President and leader Brigham Young.

Critical response.", "Hearing what others are saying, and trying to understand what it means\nListening is giving attention to a sound. When listening, a person hears what others are saying and tries to understand what it means. Listening involves complex affective, cognitive, and behavioral processes. Affective processes include the motivation to listen to others; cognitive processes include attending to, understanding, receiving, and interpreting content and relational messages; and behavioral processes include responding to others with verbal and nonverbal feedback. Listening is a skill for resolving problems. Poor listening can lead to misinterpretations, thus causing conflict or dispute. Poor listening can be exhibited by excessive interruptions, inattention, hearing what you want to hear, mentally composing a response, or having a closed mind. Listening is also linked to memory. According to one study, when there were background noises during a speech, listeners were better able to recall the information in the speech when hearing those noises again. For example, when a person reads or does something else while listening to music, he or she can recall what that was when hearing the music again later. Listening also functions rhetorically as a means of promoting cross-culture communication. What is listening? Listening begins by hearing a speaker producing the sound to be listened to. A semiotician, Roland Barthes, characterized the distinction between listening and hearing. \"Hearing is a physiological phenomenon; listening is a psychological act.\" People are always hearing, most of the time subconsciously. Listening is done by choice. It is the interpretative action taken by someone in order to understand, and potentially make sense of, something they hear.", "Sophie tosses her phone away and they struggle, inadvertently picking up David's phone in the process, which shows that David accidentally slashed his own throat while trying to use the kukri to open a champagne bottle, which Greg had done earlier, for a TikTok video—revealing there was no real murderer after all.

In April 2021, it was reported that Amandla Stenberg and Maria Bakalova were set to star in the film, while Pete Davidson and Myha'la Herrold were in talks to join the cast, with Halina Reijn now set to direct. Bakalova said she was scared to be in a horror film, having been frightened watching them, but thought that A24 films were deeper; she said that the film was \"more like an R-rated comedy.\" In May 2021, actors Lee Pace, Rachel Sennott, Chase Sui Wonders, and Conner O'Malley joined the film, with Davidson and Herrold's casting also being confirmed. Principal photography began in May 2021, with filming taking place at a Georgian stone manor house in Chappaqua, New York.", "Written details of a meeting\nMinutes, also known as minutes of meeting (abbreviation MoM), protocols or, informally, notes, are the instant written record of a meeting or hearing. They typically describe the events of the meeting and may include a list of attendees, a statement of the activities considered by the participants, and related responses or decisions for the activities. Etymology. The name \"minutes\" possibly derives from the Latin phrase \"minuta scriptura\" (literally \"small writing\") meaning \"rough notes\". Creation. Minutes may be created during the meeting by a typist or court reporter, who may use shorthand notation and then prepare the minutes and issue them to the participants afterwards. Alternatively, the meeting can be audio recorded, video recorded, or a group's appointed or informally assigned secretary may take notes, with minutes prepared later. Many government agencies use minutes recording software to record and prepare all minutes in real-time. Purpose. Minutes are the official written record of the meetings of an organization or group. They are not transcripts of those proceedings. Using \"Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised\" (RONR), the minutes should contain mainly a record of what was \"done\" at the meeting, not what was \"said\" by the members. The organization may have its own rules regarding the content of the minutes. For most organizations or groups, it is important for the minutes to be terse and only include a summary of the decisions. A verbatim report (transcript) is typically not useful.", "She breaks away and exposes all her stolen goods from her criminal past.

In 1993, the Stiftung Deutsche Kinemathek in Berlin discovered a print of \"Asphalt\" at the Gosfilmofond archive in Moscow which seemed to have been sourced from the original film negative. The chronology of scenes in print found differed from earlier versions and included extra scenes with German intertitles.", "\"Angel\" was one of the first songs written for \"Surfacing\". Sarah McLachlan said that writing it was easy, \"a real joyous occasion\", and that \"the bulk of it came in about three hours\". It was inspired by articles that she read in \"Rolling Stone\" about musicians turning to heroin to cope with the pressures of the music industry and subsequently overdosing, most notably Jonathan Melvoin, a keyboardist for the Smashing Pumpkins, who died of an overdose in 1996. She said that she identified with the feelings that might lead someone to use heroin: \"I've been in that place where you've messed up and you're so lost that you don't know who you are anymore, and you're miserable—and here's this escape route. I've never done heroin, but I've done plenty of other things to escape.\" She said that the song is about \"trying not to take responsibility for other people's problems and trying to love yourself at the same time\". Composition. The song has a sparse arrangement, with only three instruments used: a piano played by McLachlan, a drum machine programmed by Pierre Marchand, and upright bass played by Jim Creeggan of Barenaked Ladies. It was recorded in the key of D-flat major. For live performances, it is transposed up one half-step to D major, the key it was originally written in, and played without the bass.

Sporadic attempts at reform were directed at increasing efficiency and centralizing authority, but control from Spain was never very effective. The rough and diverse geography of northern South America and the limited range of proper roads made travel and communications within the viceroyalty difficult. The establishment of an autonomous Captaincy General in Caracas in 1777 and the preservation of the older Audiencia of Quito, nominally subject to the Viceroy but for most purposes independent, was a response to the necessities of effectively governing the peripheral regions. Some analysts also consider that these measures reflected a degree of local traditions that eventually contributed to the differing political and national differences among these territories once they became independent in the nineteenth century and which the unifying efforts of Simón Bolívar could not overcome. Guajira rebellion. The Spanish had never subjugated the Wayuu. The two groups were in a more or less permanent state of war. There had been rebellions in 1701 (when they destroyed a Capuchin mission), 1727 (when more than 2,000 Wayuus attacked the Spanish), 1741, 1757, 1761 and 1768.

Between 1591 and 1597 he was music director at the cathedral and seminary in Magliano Capo di Sabina. He disappears from the record after 1597, but a book of newly composed chansons by him, published in Antwerp that year, has suggested that he may have again returned to the land of his birth. Music. All of Rinaldo del Mel's surviving music is vocal, and it is both sacred and secular. He was a prolific composer, and wrote both motets and madrigals, as well as some forms that blended elements of the sacred and secular, such as a collection of \"spiritual canzonets\". His style shows the craftsmanship of an exceptional Netherlandish musical training, as well as the influence of Palestrina, who was probably his teacher, as claimed by Baini. Mel's sacred music, as would be expected of a composer of the Roman School, is more conservative stylistically than his secular music. Since his music is yet to appear in a modern edition it has not been fully evaluated by scholars. Mel wrote several sets of cyclic madrigals, i.e. sets of madrigals which set successive stanzas of a long poem (Monteverdi's \"Sestina: Lagrime d'Amante al Sepolcro dell'Amata\" is probably the most famous example of a cyclic madrigal set).", "Croatian painter (1870–1953)\nEmanuel Božidar Vidović (24 December 1870 – 1 June 1953) was a Croatian painter and graphic artist from Split. Emanuel Vidović was instrumental in bringing the modern art ideas to Split. From 1900 he was an active member of the Literary-Art Club, and in 1907, together with Ivan Meštrović, he founded the Medulić Society. Though he had trained at the Academy of Arts in Venice, he never completed his formal studies, preferring instead to paint scenes of Venice – interiors, views of canals, lagoons and motifs from around the town of Chioggia. In 1898, he returned to his home city of Split, bringing new ideas of post-impressionist style light and intense colour. He painted plein air landscapes, and more stylized, larger canvases back in his studio. His early work contained literary allusions to South Slavic history and legends, in an art nouveau style. Later work would become darker, with brighter accents, and expressionist style black outlines around forms. His landscapes, and especially his later interiors of churches around Split and Trogir were well received by critics and the public. Vidović was elected a corresponding member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1949. He exhibited his work at solo and group shows within Croatia and abroad. For many years he was Professor of Drawing at the High School, and at the School of Crafts in Split. In 1986, the Emanuel Vidović Gallery was opened in Split, featuring the life and works of the artist. Biography.", "United States automakers manufactured a broad range of convertible models during the 1950s and 1960s – from economical compact-sized models such as the Rambler American and the Studebaker Lark, to the more expensive models, such as the Packard Caribbean, Oldsmobile 98, and Imperial by Chrysler. Automakers often included a convertible body style as an available body style in a model range. Convertibles in the U.S. market peaked in sales around 1965, and fell in popularity over the next five years. Optional air conditioning was gradually becoming more popular, and the availability of sunroofs and T-tops limited the appeal of the open body style. Noise, leaks, and repairs associated with fabric tops also contributed to issues that many customers had. The popularity of convertibles was reduced by the increased travel speeds on roads (resulting in more wind and noise for occupants) and the emergence of more comprehensive vehicle crash safety standards in the United States. The market share of convertibles fell to two or three percent of total sales and the U.S. automakers discontinued the body style from their lineups. American Motors stopped making convertibles after the 1968 model year, Chrysler after 1971, Ford after 1973, and most divisions of General Motors after 1975. Cadillac held out until 1976, when they made about 14,000. The last 200 had a red, white, and blue motif and a dashboard plaque.

A video for \"Black Holes\" was also premiered by Paste Magazine and directed by Christine Hucal, featuring camcorder VHS home footage from the childhoods of the band and director interspersed with current footage. Interviews. In defense of the album's expansiveness, Milia told Jim Farber of the New York Daily News: \"You could say our new album is the work of a very indulgent artist...We didn’t give ourselves any restraints as a band and I didn’t give myself any rules as a writer.

Frontier Ruckus’ \"Eternity of Dimming\" is one of those rare gems.\"", "Warner Brothers supplied the production with the newly developed \"All Media Camera,\" which could shoot in any format, including 3-D, using twin lenses placed slightly apart to produce the stereoscopic effect necessary for it. Despite that they were smaller than the twin camera process used previously for 3D, the All-Media Cameras were still bulky and made the film shoot difficult, causing delays when transported to remote desert locations. Further, the director John Farrow and director of photography Robert Burks were unfamiliar with the new technology and had trouble adjusting to using it, while the cameras were frequently broken due to wind blowing sand into the mechanism or from other inclement weather conditions. Farrow used the technology to produce fewer gimmicks than other 3D films did at the time, with only a few scenes showing people or objects coming at the camera, such as gunfire or knives. Instead he preferred to use it to increase the depth of the expansive wide shots of the Mexican desert, or when showing figures against a landscape. The casting of Geraldine Page as the female lead was considered quite puzzling to many in Hollywood at the time. Though \"Hondo\" was not her first film, she had been known primarily as a Broadway stage actress and employed the Method acting style deemed by some to be too introspective for film, and especially for Westerns. However, she delivered a powerfully nuanced and original-feeling performance utterly appropriate to her character which later garnered her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, the first of only two acting nominations ever for a film shot or presented in 3D.", "Indian film actor in Malayalam cinema\nAlleppey Vincent was an Indian actor in Malayalam cinema.

In addition, in his secular music he often employs harmonic progressions with root motions in fifths, another feature of the Baroque style to follow. Another stylistic aspect of his madrigals is the prominent use of textural contrast, with chordal, syllabic passages alternating with passages in running thirds or sixths, or brief imitative sections. Long sections of purely contrapuntal writing are absent from his secular music, although, as in Palestrina, smooth counterpoint is the primary textural language of his sacred music.", "The title was automatically conferred upon the next heir apparent to the throne in the direct line upon birth, accession of the parent to the throne or death of the previous Dauphin, unlike the British title \"Prince of Wales\", which has always been in the gift of the monarch (traditionally conferred upon the heir's 21st birthday).

Plot summary. In the Earth of the far distant future, humans have died out and have been replaced, at least in the Americas, by a race descended from bears. Known to themselves as \"Gurrow sapiens\", they live peaceably in communal groupings, trading with each other and sharing communal property, monetary units and duties. Their science has advanced almost to that of pre-atomic age humans. Little is known of other lands on the planet. Raph, a Gurrow archaeologist, learns of the arrival on the continent's eastern seaboard of an unknown race, apparently descended from chimpanzees, who resemble 'Primate Primeval', the extinct race whose existence he has been trying to prove. Their science is more advanced and they are more war-like. It is implied that the arrivals may try to invade and colonise the lands occupied by Gurrows, and that they have developed nuclear weapons. Raph suspects that nuclear war may have been the reason why the original primates became extinct.

He was dissatisfied with the result and it was too short, so he suggested they all drink wine and urinate in the bath at the same time.

The stories in a collection may or may not share a tone, theme, setting, or characters with one another. Composition of a collection. Short story collections are made up of smaller texts—the individual short stories—in order to form a superior whole. In spite of this, each short story does not lose any of its meaning or narrative independence by being included in a collection. This does not mean that short stories do not gain any new meaning from being included in a collection, though. Because each story's context has changed, surrounded by other stories with their own meanings and tones, the meaning and tone of any individual story might also be affected. In addition to the individual stories, short story collections may also include notes by the author. The act of writing short stories is different from the act of gathering short stories into a collection. For instance, the short story author may or may not be the one who compiles the short story collection, even though the author penned the individual stories. This is especially obvious in the case of posthumous publications. Note that short story collections should be considered different from traditional novels and other narratives because collections do not forward a cohesive storyline in the same way novels do.

Surrounding cities include Kurume to the west, Nakatsu to the north, and Kusu to the east. Hita is a natural basin surrounded by mountains, with several rivers that eventually become the Chikugo River. Due to this connection, although Hita is placed within Ōita Prefecture, it shares a historical connection to Fukuoka Prefecture. The dialect used in Hita has characteristics of the Hichiku dialect used in Fukuoka, Nagasaki, and Saga Prefectures. Many rivers that run through Hita join up to the Mikuma River, and later the Chikugo River. These rivers were used to distribute lumber to Kurume and Ōkawa at the end of the Edo Period, but with the completion of the Yoake Dam, the use of this route stopped.

This is most likely a secondary evolved characteristic, which means there is not necessarily a connection between the teeth and the original dermal scales.

They feature summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition, with more than 200 teams, representing sovereign states and territories, participating. By default, the Games generally substitute for any world championships during the year in which they take place (however, each class usually maintains its own records). The Olympic Games are held every four years. Since 1994, they have alternated between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years during the four-year Olympiad. Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, held in Olympia, Greece from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, which encompasses all entities and individuals involved in the Olympic Games. The Olympic Charter defines their structure and authority. The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in numerous changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with disabilities, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental Games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games.", "Some sources say as many as 40,000 attended. These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration, horse and chariot racing events. It has been widely written that during the Games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished. This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce. This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars. The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were traveling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus. See also Finley and Pleket. The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend; one of the most popular myths identifies Heracles and his father Zeus as the progenitors of the Games. According to legend, it was Heracles who first called the Games \"Olympic\" and established the custom of holding them every four years. The myth continues that after Heracles completed his twelve labours, he built the Olympic Stadium as an honour to Zeus. Following its completion, he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a \"stadion\" (, Latin: , \"stage\"), which later became a unit of distance. The most widely accepted inception date for the Ancient Olympics is 776 BC; this is based on inscriptions, found at Olympia, listing the winners of a footrace held every four years starting in 776 BC.", "The IOC also endorses the Deaflympics and the Special Olympics. The IOC need to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to the acceptance of professional athletes participating at the Games. The growing importance of mass media has created the issue of corporate sponsorship and general commercialisation of the Games. World Wars I and II led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Olympics; large-scale boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics; and the 2020 Olympics were postponed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 restrictions. The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag, torch, and opening and closing ceremonies. Over 14,000 athletes competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics combined, in 40 different sports and 448 events. The first-, second-, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.", "It was widely commented upon in the press that the day after the broadcast of the first episode, which features problems with the 1,000-day countdown clock, the real-life clock in Trafalgar Square broke soon after it had been launched by Lord Coe and London mayor Boris Johnson. An additional coincidence occurred when some of the first athletes to arrive in London for the Olympics suffered delays; their bus drivers were unfamiliar with London and unable to find the Olympic Park, in scenes that closely resembled the plot of episode 2. \"The Games\" plagiarism accusation. \"Twenty Twelve\" has been criticised as bearing a strong resemblance to the Australian mockumentary series \"The Games\", a similar series set before the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Writer of \"The Games\" John Clarke said, \"We worked very hard on that project and we had long conversations with these people who've now done a show like that in Britain\". The BBC denied claims of plagiarism. \"It is a very different show, the only similarities between them are that they are both set around the Olympics,\" a corporation source said.

This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and terrorism. Every two years, the Olympics and its media exposure provide athletes with the chance to attain national and international fame. The Games also provide an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world. The Olympic Games have become a significant global event, fostering international cooperation and cultural exchange. At the same time, hosting the Olympic Games can also bring significant economic benefits and challenges to the host city, affecting infrastructure, tourism and local communities. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAncient Olympics. The Ancient Olympic Games (, \"ta Olympia\") were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece. The date of the festival was determined according to a complicated formula whereby the midpoint of the festival would occur during the second full moon after the summer solstice—usually late August or early September. This \"came after the annual harvest but before the picking of the olives.\" Heralds were sent from Elis to announce the dates. Competition at first was among only \"legitimate sons of free-born Greek parents.\" However, after Macedonia, and then Rome, conquered Greece, the ten Olympic judges loosened the earlier standard and permitted anyone who spoke Greek to participate.

Tradition has it that Coroebus, a cook from the city of Elis, was the first Olympic champion, which indicates that the competition was not limited to the aristocracy. The Olympics were of fundamental religious importance, and the sporting events, which were held alongside ritual sacrifices honouring both Zeus (whose famous statue by Phidias stood in his temple at Olympia) and Pelops (divine hero and mythical king of Olympia), did not start until the festival's second day. (Pelops was famous for his chariot race with King Oenomaus of Pisatis.) The winners of the events were admired and immortalised in poems and statues.

Produced during the Second World War, the film was intended as a morale booster for American troops and their families. Plot. The film is essentially a two-part program. The first half consists of a romantic comedy storyline involving an aerialist, played by Gene Kelly, who is drafted into the US Army but really wants to join the Air Force. During training, he falls in love with Kathryn (played by Kathryn Grayson), the daughter of his commanding officer, who has similarly put her singing career on hold in order to serve by providing entertainment for the troops. Unusually for this type of a film (and for this era of Hollywood), the character Kathryn has only recently met her father for the first time since she was a baby, her parents having separated but remaining married. A related subplot has Kathryn conniving to get her parents (played by John Boles and Mary Astor) to reconcile. During the first part of the film, Grayson sings several numbers and Kelly performs one of his most famous routines, dancing with a mop as a partner. The secondary plot involves preparations for a major live show for the soldiers which will feature many MGM musical and comedy stars. For the second half of the film, all pretenses of a storyline are effectively abandoned as the film instead becomes a variety showcase of comedy, song, and dance, with all of the performers (save Kelly and Grayson) appearing as themselves. The show portion is hosted by Mickey Rooney.

Blackadder interrogates Captain Darling, who vehemently denies being a spy and says that he is \"as British as Queen Victoria\", to which Blackadder sarcastically replies \"So your father is German, you're half German and you married a German?\". Blackadder's retort references the fact that Victoria was a member of the House of Hanover and that her husband Prince Albert was a prince from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1917, Victoria's grandson, King George V, changed the name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor in an effort to appease British nationalist feelings. The final episode of this series, \"Goodbyeee\", although true to the series' usual comedy style through most of the preceding scenes, featured a non-comedic final scene, in which the main characters (except General Melchett) are finally sent over the top.

Heaney then wanted the title “Easter Water,” but this name was also discarded in favor of the final name: \"Field Work\". Heaney said of the final title: \"I gave \"Field Work\" that title partly because there’s an element of samplings in it. But I think there’s an opener note in it as well. What holds \"Field Work\" together—this is only my view of it—is a certain ease of the voice.\" Heaney also provided his own explanation of how all his titles came about: “What usually happens is that I start to look for one [a title] once a ‘critical mass’ of poems gets written. I find that if I have a working title at that stage – say when half a volume is in existence – the title itself can help in shaping, or at least inclining and suggesting, the poems to come.”\nReception.

Background. \"Field Work\" was Heaney’s first collection of poetry since his most celebrated collection, \"North\" in 1975. \"Field Work\" can largely be read as record of Heaney’s four years (1972-1976) living in rural County Wicklow in the Republic of Ireland after leaving the violence of The Troubles. Heaney had previously been living in Belfast as a professor at Queen's University. Denis O’Donoghue has referred to this period as \"years of retreat only in the religious or monastic sense, a quiet time for thinking and renewal. Certain themes were sequestered, so that Heaney might start out again from first principles and deep affiliations.\" Joshua Weiner writes: \"While the move south seemed to some a deliberate withdrawal from a previous political commitment to fight the British presence in Ireland, \"Field Work\" indicates rather a growing commitment to stay engaged, but to do so by maintaining the long view, which asks questions more than it assumes positions.\" In a 1981 interview with Frank Kinahan, Heaney said \"Field Work\" \"was an attempt to try to do something deliberately: to change the note and to lengthen the line, and to bring elements of my social self, elements of my usual nature, which is more convivial than most of the poems before that might suggest, to try to bring all that into play.

In its own way it was a book of change also; it moved me from the intensity of \"North\" to something more measured, in both formal and emotional terms.\" In the same interview, Heaney also said: “I tried very deliberately in \"Field Work\" to turn from a broody, phonetically self-relishing kind of writing to something closer to my own speaking voice. And I think that from \"Field Work\" onwards I have been following that direction.

A short story collection is distinguished from an anthology of fiction, which would contain work by several authors (e.g., \"Les Soirées de Médan\"). The stories in a collection may or may not share a tone, theme, setting, or characters with one another. Composition of a collection. Short story collections are made up of smaller texts—the individual short stories—in order to form a superior whole. In spite of this, each short story does not lose any of its meaning or narrative independence by being included in a collection. This does not mean that short stories do not gain any new meaning from being included in a collection, though. Because each story's context has changed, surrounded by other stories with their own meanings and tones, the meaning and tone of any individual story might also be affected. In addition to the individual stories, short story collections may also include notes by the author. The act of writing short stories is different from the act of gathering short stories into a collection. For instance, the short story author may or may not be the one who compiles the short story collection, even though the author penned the individual stories. This is especially obvious in the case of posthumous publications. Note that short story collections should be considered different from traditional novels and other narratives because collections do not forward a cohesive storyline in the same way novels do. Instead, short story collections group individual pieces, each with their own narratives.", "Alvarez went on to say: “If Heaney really is the best we can do, then the whole troubled, exploratory thrust of modern poetry has been a diversion from the right true way.”\nUpon Heaney’s death in August 2013, Sean O’Hagan wrote for \"The Guardian\": “\"Field Work\" spoke of a world I knew and had just left behind, physically if not emotionally or psychologically…This was poetry I could connect with on several levels, about strange things I had seen with my own eyes and was now seeing through his.”\nBlake Morrison likewise wrote in \"The Guardian\" after Heaney's death that in \"Field Work\", Heaney \"presents himself as a wood-kerne escaped from the massacre, a man who has left the urban battlefront for Wordsworthian seclusion or Ovidian exile.\" Poems.

Once there, unemployment eventually leads him to join a gang of blackmailers involved in sex crimes, in turn leading to his ruin. Controversy. When the team of Aik Gunahoon Ka Shehr approached the Pakistan Film Censor Board for a clearance certificate, objection was raised over the phrase Gunahoon Ka Shehr. Later the name was modified to Aik Gunahoon Ka Shehr. What exactly they aimed to achieve by this is still a mystery. Secondly, the members of the respected censor board charged that the film contained erotic scenes and dialogue. Consequently, the film appeared before a full board who chopped off several scenes and dialogues which they considered ‘unnecessary’ and ‘irrelevant’, resulting in the producer reshooting them. Annoyed, producer Saeed Iqbal presented his stand before the censor board members, stating that the story of the film depicts the true picture of youth today who indulge in sex and crime. \"The objection was unfair because already a number of Pakistani, Indian and English movies with sexual content are being exhibited at cinemas and cable networks throughout the country,\" he said.

Dancer Fitzgerald Sample had conducted focus groups in a number of cities to determine public perceptions on crime. The focus groups found that the public believed police should be the ones to prevent crime, but that they were unwilling to pay more in taxes to support more officers. They recommended a campaign which would \"emphasize that individual actions can reduce crime\" and \"offer easily accessible opportunities for people to participate.\" The task was given to Jack Keil, executive vice president and creative director of Dancer Fitzgerald Sample.

According to popular conception, these people often buried their stolen fortunes in remote places, intending to return to them later (often with the use of a pirate’s treasure map). Pirates burying treasure was a rare occurrence, with the only known instance being William Kidd, who buried some of his wealth on Gardiners Island. The myth of buried pirate treasure was popularized by such 19th-century fiction as \"Wolfert Webber\", \"The Gold-Bug\", and \"Treasure Island\". The idea of treasure maps leading to buried treasure is considered a fictional device. There are cases of buried treasure from different historical periods, such as the Dacian king Decebalus and Visigoth king Alaric I, who both changed the course of rivers to hide their treasures. Legends of buried pirate treasure have existed for centuries, but authenticated discoveries are rare. For example, extensive excavations on Oak Island, Nova Scotia have not yielded any treasure. The only authenticated treasure chest in the United States is kept at the Pirate Soul Museum in St. Augustine, Florida. Buried treasure is a cultural concept and not the same as a hoard, which is typically found by archaeologists and metal detectors. The Fenn treasure, reportedly buried by millionaire Forrest Fenn in 2010, was found in 2020 in Wyoming. Pirates. Pirates burying treasure was rare.", "In 1911, American author Ralph D. Paine conducted a survey of all known or purported stories of buried treasure and published them in \"The Book of Buried Treasure\". He found a common trait in all the stories: there was always a lone survivor of a piratical crew who somehow preserved a chart showing where the treasure was buried, but unable to return himself, he transfers the map or information to a friend or shipmate, usually on his deathbed. This person would then go search in vain for the treasure, but not before transferring the legend down to another hapless seeker. Cases. The Roman historian Dio Cassius says that, in the early 2nd century, the Dacian king Decebalus had changed the course of the river Sargetia and buried tons of gold and silver in the riverbed. Later, he ordered the river to be restored, and the slaves involved in the works to be executed. However, one of his nobles revealed the treasure's location to the Romans. The Byzantine historian Jordanes tells a similar story of the burial of the Visigoth king Alaric I and his treasure under the river Busento in 410. The burial places of the Khazar kings (\"qoruq\") and other inner Asian people were also under a rerouted river. There are a number of reports of supposed buried pirate treasure that surfaced much earlier than these works, indicating that the idea was around for more than a century before those stories were published.", "The only pirate known to have actually buried treasure was William Kidd, who is believed to have buried at least some of his wealth on Gardiners Island near Long Island before sailing into New York City. Kidd had originally been commissioned as a privateer for England, but his behavior had strayed into outright piracy, and he hoped that his treasure could serve as a bargaining chip in negotiations to avoid punishment. His bid was unsuccessful, however, and Kidd was hanged as a pirate. In English fiction, there are three well-known stories that helped to popularize the myth of buried pirate treasure: \"Wolfert Webber\" (1824) by Washington Irving, \"The Gold-Bug\" (1843) by Edgar Allan Poe and \"Treasure Island\" (1883) by Robert Louis Stevenson. These stories differ widely in plot and literary treatment but are all based on the William Kidd legend. David Cordingly states that \"The effect of \"Treasure Island\" on our perception of pirates cannot be overestimated,\" and says the idea of treasure maps leading to buried treasure \"is an entirely fictional device\". Stevenson's \"Treasure Island\" was directly influenced by Irving's \"Wolfert Webber,\" Stevenson saying in his preface, \"It is my debt to Washington Irving that exercises my conscience, and justly so, for I believe plagiarism was rarely carried farther... the whole inner spirit and a good deal of the material detail of my first chapters... were the property of Washington Irving.\"", "Book of several short stories\nA short story collection is a book of short stories and/or novellas by a single author. A short story collection is distinguished from an anthology of fiction, which would contain work by several authors (e.g., \"Les Soirées de Médan\"). The stories in a collection may or may not share a tone, theme, setting, or characters with one another. Composition of a collection. Short story collections are made up of smaller texts—the individual short stories—in order to form a superior whole. In spite of this, each short story does not lose any of its meaning or narrative independence by being included in a collection. This does not mean that short stories do not gain any new meaning from being included in a collection, though. Because each story's context has changed, surrounded by other stories with their own meanings and tones, the meaning and tone of any individual story might also be affected. In addition to the individual stories, short story collections may also include notes by the author. The act of writing short stories is different from the act of gathering short stories into a collection. For instance, the short story author may or may not be the one who compiles the short story collection, even though the author penned the individual stories. This is especially obvious in the case of posthumous publications. Note that short story collections should be considered different from traditional novels and other narratives because collections do not forward a cohesive storyline in the same way novels do. Instead, short story collections group individual pieces, each with their own narratives.", "Over time other significant burials took place in this area such as Edward Plantagenet (the Black Prince), who was interred on the south side of Becket's shrine.

The achievements have now been replaced by replicas, though the originals can still be seen nearby, and the tester was restored in 2006. King Henry IV. Also buried in the chapel are King Henry IV and his second wife, Joan of Navarre, Queen of England. Henry's tomb is on the north side of Trinity Chapel, next to the shrine of St Thomas Becket. It was unusual for a King of England not to be buried at Westminster Abbey, but Becket's cult was then at its height, as evidenced in the \"Canterbury Tales\", and Henry seemed particularly devoted to it, or at least keen to be associated with it. Reasons for his interment in Canterbury are debatable, but it is highly likely that Henry deliberately associated himself with the martyred saint for reasons of political expediency, namely, the legitimation of his dynasty after seizing the throne from his cousin, Richard II. Significantly, at his coronation, he was anointed with holy oil which was said to have been given to Becket by the Virgin Mary shortly before his death in 1170; this oil was placed inside a distinct eagle-shaped container of gold.", "2016 collection of memoirs and essays by Joe R.

A crown is often, by extension, a symbol of the monarch's government or items endorsed by it. The word itself is used, particularly in Commonwealth countries, as an abstract name for the monarchy itself (and, by extension, the state of which said monarch is head) as distinct from the individual who inhabits it (that is, \"The Crown\").

Evidence of Henry's deliberate connexion to St Thomas lies in the structure of the tomb itself. The wooden panel at the western end of his tomb bears a painting of the martyrdom of Becket, and the tester, or wooden canopy, above the tomb is painted with Henry's personal motto, 'Soverayne', alternated by crowned golden eagles. Likewise, the three large coats of arms that dominate the tester painting are surrounded by collars of SS, a golden eagle enclosed in each tiret. The presence of such eagle motifs most likely points directly to Henry's coronation oil and his ideological association with St Thomas. Sometime after the King's death, an imposing tomb was built for him and his queen, probably commissioned and paid for by Queen Joan herself. On top of the tomb chest lie detailed alabaster effigies of the King and Queen, crowned and dressed in their ceremonial robes. Henry's body was evidently well-embalmed, as an exhumation in 1832 established, allowing historians to state with reasonable certainty that the effigies are accurate portrait. The Corona Tower.

According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the first recorded use of the word was by Virginia Woolf, who, citing William Makepeace Thackeray, referenced it in her 1929 essay \"A Room of One's Own.\" The term was used in the \"Times Educational Supplement\" in 1957, and the following year in \"Universities Quarterly\". When expanded, the universities are almost always referred to as \"Oxford and Cambridge\", the order in which they were founded. A notable exception is Tokyo's \"Cambridge and Oxford Society\"; this probably arises from the fact that the Cambridge Club was founded there first, and also had more members than its Oxford counterpart when they amalgamated in 1905. Meaning. In addition to being a collective term, \"Oxbridge\" is often used as shorthand for characteristics the two institutions share:\nCriticism."], "distances": [26.52541694596755, 23.96359054692108, 21.836596990358178, 20.14422410162087, 18.62189234541325, 18.440308360207148, 16.992499797784564, 16.29826981912006, 15.420866438810693, 15.241144575506501], "supports": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "metadatas": [{"mapped_id": "0d98c2fd-2375-40e6-b6ec-429e23b54bba", "doc_name": "Crown", "support": 0, "pool_index": 264}, {"mapped_id": "0136c6f6-a24a-4cef-a6e0-18c84b30339f", "doc_name": "List of British monarchy records", "support": 0, "pool_index": 1589}, {"mapped_id": "0136c6f6-a24a-4cef-a6e0-18c84b30339f", "doc_name": "List of British monarchy records", "support": 0, "pool_index": 1588}, {"mapped_id": "075fcad0-3d05-449c-b372-a07ebbe3d334", "doc_name": "Mariana Vicente", "support": 1, "pool_index": 35}, {"mapped_id": "0136c6f6-a24a-4cef-a6e0-18c84b30339f", "doc_name": "List of British monarchy records", "support": 0, "pool_index": 1586}, {"mapped_id": "0d98c2fd-2375-40e6-b6ec-429e23b54bba", "doc_name": "Crown", "support": 0, "pool_index": 262}, {"mapped_id": "0153cd9c-7536-4ed5-9f1f-0dbf8472a40d", "doc_name": "Trinity Chapel", "support": 0, "pool_index": 2237}, {"mapped_id": "0136c6f6-a24a-4cef-a6e0-18c84b30339f", "doc_name": "List of British monarchy records", "support": 0, "pool_index": 1585}, {"mapped_id": "099b1265-4713-4faf-8444-f7b247ffb05f", "doc_name": "Emperor Saga", "support": 0, "pool_index": 286}, {"mapped_id": "0db3fe6c-ccbb-4d63-9ed5-063d81e556d0", "doc_name": "Oxbridge", "support": 0, "pool_index": 2404}], "recall": 1.0, "precision": 0.1, "ndcg": 0.43067655807339306, "mrr": 0.25}

The shrine became one of the most popular pilgrimage sites in England. Origin. The chapel was constructed between 1179 and 1184, replacing a much smaller chapel of the same name destroyed by fire, along with much of the rest of the choir, in 1174. Its predecessor was where Becket celebrated his first mass following his installation as Archbishop of Canterbury. Thomas Becket. In 1220, Becket's remains were translated from his first tomb to the finished chapel. As a result of this event, the chapel became a major pilgrimage site, inspiring Geoffrey Chaucer to write \"The Canterbury Tales\" in 1387 and with routes (e.g. from Southwark (Chaucer's route) and the Pilgrim's Way to/from Winchester) converging on the cathedral. Becket's shrine stood until it was destroyed in 1540. This was done on orders from King Henry VIII as vengeance for his ancestor, Henry II. The king also destroyed Becket's bones and ordered that all mention of his name be obliterated. The pavement where the shrine stood in the chapel is today marked by a lighted candle. Modern day archbishops of Canterbury celebrate the Eucharist at this place to commemorate Becket's martyrdom and the translation of his body from his first burial place to this chapel.

In his account of a visit to the cathedral, before the destruction of the shrine, Erasmus said that the saint's head was displayed in the crypt. Records of valuable gifts made there by pilgrims in the 13th century do, however, indicate that there were some relics of St Thomas Becket in the Corona. The shrines of St Odo and St Wilfred were also eventually placed there.

The achievements have now been replaced by replicas, though the originals can still be seen nearby, and the tester was restored in 2006. King Henry IV. Also buried in the chapel are King Henry IV and his second wife, Joan of Navarre, Queen of England. Henry's tomb is on the north side of Trinity Chapel, next to the shrine of St Thomas Becket. It was unusual for a King of England not to be buried at Westminster Abbey, but Becket's cult was then at its height, as evidenced in the \"Canterbury Tales\", and Henry seemed particularly devoted to it, or at least keen to be associated with it. Reasons for his interment in Canterbury are debatable, but it is highly likely that Henry deliberately associated himself with the martyred saint for reasons of political expediency, namely, the legitimation of his dynasty after seizing the throne from his cousin, Richard II. Significantly, at his coronation, he was anointed with holy oil which was said to have been given to Becket by the Virgin Mary shortly before his death in 1170; this oil was placed inside a distinct eagle-shaped container of gold.", "Colorado is an unincorporated community in Bastrop County, Texas, United States.

Shepherds brought their fleeces to a local collection point, for example Chipping Camden for wool from the Cotswolds, where it would be graded, paid for, consolidated into bales, sold to wholesalers, and shipped to the manufacturer. The existence of bales in ancient times is attested by the custom of the English Lord Chancellor to sit on the so-called Woolsack from which he presides over the House of Lords. This seat is therefore not in reality a \"sack\", in which the shepherds probably brought 20 or so fleeces, probably two per mule, being the equivalent of today's \"sheet\", but is rather a bale, compacted by the weight of human feet at the merchant's premises.

Naps are most often taken as a response to drowsiness during waking hours. A nap is a form of biphasic or polyphasic sleep, where the latter terms also include longer periods of sleep in addition to one period. For years, scientists have been investigating the benefits of napping, including the 30-minute nap as well as sleep durations of 1–2 hours. Performance across a wide range of cognitive processes has been tested. Benefits. Sara Mednick conducted a study experimenting on the effects of napping, caffeine, and a placebo. Her results showed that a 60–90-minute nap is more effective than caffeine in memory and cognition. Power nap. A power nap, also known as a Stage 2 nap, is a short slumber of 20 minutes or less which terminates before the occurrence of deep slow-wave sleep, intended to quickly revitalize the napper. The power nap is meant to maximize the benefits of sleep versus time. It is used to supplement normal sleep, especially when a sleeper has accumulated a sleep deficit. The greater the sleep deficit, the more effective the nap. Prescribed napping for sleep disorders. It has been shown that excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) can be improved by prescribed napping in narcolepsy. Apart from narcolepsy, it has not been demonstrated that naps are beneficial for EDS in other sleep disorders.

A short story collection is distinguished from an anthology of fiction, which would contain work by several authors (e.g., \"Les Soirées de Médan\"). The stories in a collection may or may not share a tone, theme, setting, or characters with one another. Composition of a collection. Short story collections are made up of smaller texts—the individual short stories—in order to form a superior whole. In spite of this, each short story does not lose any of its meaning or narrative independence by being included in a collection. This does not mean that short stories do not gain any new meaning from being included in a collection, though. Because each story's context has changed, surrounded by other stories with their own meanings and tones, the meaning and tone of any individual story might also be affected. In addition to the individual stories, short story collections may also include notes by the author. The act of writing short stories is different from the act of gathering short stories into a collection. For instance, the short story author may or may not be the one who compiles the short story collection, even though the author penned the individual stories. This is especially obvious in the case of posthumous publications. Note that short story collections should be considered different from traditional novels and other narratives because collections do not forward a cohesive storyline in the same way novels do. Instead, short story collections group individual pieces, each with their own narratives.", "2000 UK film\nCinderella is a television film released on January 1, 2000, in the UK, directed by Beeban Kidron.

They soon released their first demo \"I Am Me\" and in October 1990, their second demo, \"Does It Make a Difference\".

In these early accounts, Robin Hood's partisanship of the lower classes, his devotion to the Virgin Mary and associated special regard for women, his outstanding skill as an archer, his anti-clericalism, and his particular animosity towards the Sheriff of Nottingham are already clear. Little John, Much the Miller's Son, and Will Scarlet (as Will \"Scarlok\" or \"Scathelocke\") all appear, although not yet Maid Marian or Friar Tuck. The friar has been part of the legend since at least the later 15th century, when he is mentioned in a Robin Hood play script. In modern popular culture, Robin Hood is typically seen as a contemporary and supporter of the late-12th-century king Richard the Lionheart, Robin being driven to outlawry during the misrule of Richard's brother John while Richard was away at the Third Crusade. This view first gained currency in the 16th century. It is not supported by the earliest ballads. The early compilation, \"A Gest of Robyn Hode\", names the king as 'Edward'; and while it does show Robin Hood accepting the King's pardon, he later repudiates it and returns to the greenwood.

The first printed version is \"A Gest of Robyn Hode\" (c. 1500), a collection of separate stories that attempts to unite the episodes into a single continuous narrative. After this comes \"Robin Hood and the Potter\", contained in a manuscript of c. 1503. \"The Potter\" is markedly different in tone from \"The Monk\": whereas the earlier tale is \"a thriller\" the latter is more comic, its plot involving trickery and cunning rather than straightforward force. Other early texts are dramatic pieces, the earliest being the fragmentary \"Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham\" (c. 1475). These are particularly noteworthy as they show Robin's integration into May Day rituals towards the end of the Middle Ages; \"Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham\", among other points of interest, contains the earliest reference to Friar Tuck.

It is also the most populated city in Tuscany, with 360,930 inhabitants in 2023, and 984,991 in its metropolitan area. Florence was a centre of medieval European trade and finance and one of the wealthiest cities of that era. It is considered by many academics to have been the birthplace of the Renaissance, becoming a major artistic, cultural, commercial, political, economic and financial center. During this time, Florence rose to a position of enormous influence in Italy, Europe, and beyond. Its turbulent political history includes periods of rule by the powerful Medici family and numerous religious and republican revolutions. From 1865 to 1871 the city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. The Florentine dialect forms the base of standard Italian and it became the language of culture throughout Italy due to the prestige of the masterpieces by Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, Giovanni Boccaccio, Niccolò Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini. The city attracts millions of tourists each year, and UNESCO declared the Historic Centre of Florence a World Heritage Site in 1982. The city is noted for its culture, Renaissance art and architecture and monuments. The city also contains numerous museums and art galleries, such as the Uffizi Gallery and the Palazzo Pitti, and still exerts an influence in the fields of art, culture and politics. Due to Florence's artistic and architectural heritage, \"Forbes\" ranked it as one of the most beautiful cities in the world in 2010.", "Reservoir in Austin, Texas, US\nLady Bird Lake (formerly, and still colloquially referred to as Town Lake) is a river-like reservoir on the Colorado River in Austin, Texas, United States. The City of Austin created the reservoir in 1960 as a cooling pond for a new city power plant. The lake, which has a surface area of , is now used primarily for recreation and flood control. The reservoir is named in honor of former First Lady of the United States Lady Bird Johnson. Lady Bird Lake is the easternmost lake of a chain of reservoirs on the river, which is completely located in Texas, and should not be confused with the larger Colorado River located in the Southwestern United States. This chain, known locally as the Texas Highland Lakes, also includes Lake Buchanan, Inks Lake, Lake LBJ, Lake Marble Falls, Lake Travis, and Lake Austin. History. The City of Austin constructed Longhorn Dam in 1960 to form Town Lake. The city needed the reservoir to serve as a cooling pond for the Holly Street Power Plant, which operated from 1960 until 2007. Before 1971, the shoreline of Town Lake was mostly a mixture of weeds, unkempt bushes, and trash. Local television station KTBC referred to the lake as an \"eyesore\". Some concerned Austinites led small projects to clean up the lake. Roberta Crenshaw, chair of the Austin Board of Parks and Recreation, purchased nearly 400 trees and shrubs in an effort to spearhead parkland development around the lake."], "distances": [34.431795973381014, 32.281330786848756, 31.20937052433886, 30.629605675126303, 23.93187389792001, 18.937839602261406, 18.912775241246873, 18.86002579364753, 17.22283485012133, 17.2019518658811], "supports": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "metadatas": [{"mapped_id": "017bc2a1-4f23-40df-9048-7772bbe0d029", "doc_name": "Embassy of the United Kingdom, Rome", "support": 0, "pool_index": 1891}, {"mapped_id": "017bc2a1-4f23-40df-9048-7772bbe0d029", "doc_name": "Embassy of the Philippines, Rome", "support": 0, "pool_index": 1892}, {"mapped_id": "017bc2a1-4f23-40df-9048-7772bbe0d029", "doc_name": "Embassy of the United States, Rome", "support": 1, "pool_index": 1890}, {"mapped_id": "073c2a08-384e-42af-bd54-94427eeefb85", "doc_name": "List of diplomatic missions in Washington, D.C.", "support": 1, "pool_index": 2395}, {"mapped_id": "017bc2a1-4f23-40df-9048-7772bbe0d029", "doc_name": "Embassy of the Philippines, Rome", "support": 0, "pool_index": 1894}, {"mapped_id": "098ef241-00c9-4a36-b472-235662c1e633", "doc_name": "United States Post Office–Norwich Main", "support": 1, "pool_index": 2120}, {"mapped_id": "017bc2a1-4f23-40df-9048-7772bbe0d029", "doc_name": "Embassy of the Philippines, Rome", "support": 0, "pool_index": 1893}, {"mapped_id": "0ea5ea12-bbe9-4c0c-9a6a-45c21dfdf1f5", "doc_name": "Hard Choices (film)", "support": 0, "pool_index": 442}, {"mapped_id": "081fe9c1-0708-477b-84cf-ac9e87070fa6", "doc_name": "Florence", "support": 0, "pool_index": 96}, {"mapped_id": "0756f205-db3b-4680-8929-c18e46bc3995", "doc_name": "Lady Bird Lake", "support": 0, "pool_index": 1705}], "recall": 1.0, "precision": 0.3, "ndcg": 0.6039071644781281, "mrr": 0.3333333333333333}

A malfunction in the booster guidance system resulted in excessive spacecraft speed. Reversed command signals caused the spacecraft to pitch in the wrong direction and the TM antenna to lose earth acquisition, and mid-course correction was not possible. Finally, a spurious signal during the terminal maneuver prevented transmission of useful images. Ranger 3 missed the Moon by approximately 36,800 km on January 28 and was now in a heliocentric orbit. Some useful engineering data were obtained from the flight. Preparation for launch. Preparation for Ranger 3 was complicated by developmental issues with the Agena B stage, which had failed to operate correctly on Rangers 1-2. Agena was primarily the domain of the U.S. Air Force, who intended to use it for military payloads, and NASA had originally assumed it would begin flying in late 1960 or early 1961 by which time any developmental issues with the stage could be weeded out. However, Agena B ended up taking longer to put into service than originally anticipated and its performance also turned out to be somewhat less than expected, which forced some of the planned experiments on the Block II Rangers to be cancelled. While the Thor-Agena B had begun flying in October 1960, the Atlas-Agena B did not make its maiden voyage until July 1961, meaning that Ranger 1 was only the second time this launch vehicle combination been flown. This delay was explained by the fact that Air Force programs such as MIDAS were taking much longer to develop than Ranger.", "In addition, as 1961 ended, Agena Bs had malfunctioned no less than seven times (the two Ranger launches and five Thor-Agena launches). Major General Osmond J. Ritland, Commander of the Air Force Space Systems Division in Inglewood, California, promised NASA that all problems with Agena would be corrected and, because they also affected DoD programs, the issue was being taken \"quite seriously\". Among other changes made would be a thorough review of all Lockheed field operating equipment and procedures. In addition, an effort would be made to ensure that checkout procedures on U.S. Air Force and NASA Agenas were identical and any differences in them eliminated. In mid-December 1961, Atlas 121D and Agena 6003 arrived at Cape Canaveral and were erected on LC-12. On January 18, 1962, Ranger 3 was stacked atop the booster, but the following day attempted fueling of the Atlas went awry when a tear was found in the intermediate bulkhead separating the LOX and RP-1 tanks. This would mean that the launch vehicle would have to be taken down from the pad for repairs, delaying the launch an entire month. However, Air Force and Convair officials instead suggested the novel solution of doing the repairs right there on LC-12. The Atlas's sustainer engine was removed and lowered into the flame deflector pit and wooden scaffolding installed so that technicians could go up into the RP-1 tank, remove the damaged intermediate bulkhead, and replace it. By January 26, repairs were completed.", "Association football match at the 1950 FIFA World Cup\nFootball match\nOn 29 June 1950, the United States defeated England 1–0 in a World Cup group match at Estádio Independência in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Before the game, England were heavy favorites against a hastily assembled U.S. team, which was composed of part-time players. The game's only goal was scored by Haitian-born U.S. center forward Joe Gaetjens. This game and the U.S. team were profiled by author Geoffrey Douglas in his book \"The Game of Their Lives\", which was made into a film of the same name (later renamed \"The Miracle Match\"). Background. The 1950 FIFA World Cup was England's World Cup debut, the Football Association having boycotted the previous three tournaments owing to a dispute with FIFA over payments made to amateur players, which had been resolved four years earlier. England and the United States were both drawn in Group 2, along with Spain and Chile: under the rules of the competition only the group winner from this four-nation round-robin would progress to the final stage. Each team had played one previous match in the group, England having beaten Chile 2–0 and the United States losing 3–1 to Spain. At the time, the English had a reputation as the \"Kings of Football\", with a post-war record of 23 wins, 4 losses, and 3 draws. They had beaten the Italians 4–0 and the Portuguese 10–0 in Lisbon two weeks before that.", "1AF (AFNORTH) is also the designated air component for the United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM). USNORTHCOM's area of responsibility includes the continental United States, Canada, and Mexico, and its air, land and maritime approaches. With the transfer of responsibility for continental air defense from the active duty component of the Air Force to the Air National Guard, 1 AF became the first numbered air force to be made up primarily of citizen airmen. Furthermore, 1AF now has operational control (OPCON) of the Civil Air Patrol. History. One of the four original numbered air forces, First Air Force was activated as the Northeast Air District of the GHQ Air Force on 18 December 1940, at Mitchel Field, Long Island, New York. It was redesignated First Air Force on 9 April 1941 with a mission for the defense of the Northeast and Great Lakes regions of the United States. World War II. During the initial months after the Pearl Harbor Attack, First Air Force organized what would eventually become the core of the Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command (AAFSC), obtaining most of its forces from I Bomber Command to combat the German U-boat threat along the Atlantic Coast. AAFSC would eventually expand that mission to the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean until the antisubmarine mission was taken over completely by the Navy in mid-1943. Beginning in May 1942, the mission of First Air Force became operational training of units and crews, and the replacement training of individuals for bombardment, fighter, and reconnaissance operations.", "In March 1946, USAAF Chief General Carl Spaatz had undertaken a major re-organization of the postwar USAAF that had included the establishment of Major Commands (MAJCOM), who would report directly to HQ United States Army Air Forces. Continental Air Forces was inactivated, and First Air Force was assigned to the postwar Air Defense Command in March 1946 and subsequently to Continental Air Command (ConAC) in December 1948 being primarily concerned with air defense. First Air Force Headquarters was located at Fort Slocum, New York, from 1946 to 1949. The command was originally assigned the region of the New England states, along with New York and New Jersey. With the inactivation of the ADC Eleventh Air Force on 1 July 1948 due to budget restrictions, command's region of responsibility was increased to include the upper Midwest states of Michigan and Ohio, along with the Mid-Atlantic region south to the North Carolina/Virginia Border. In 1949 Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units were placed under First Air Force command, with its active-duty units being reassigned to Eastern Air Defense Force (EADF) or to the 30th, 32d or 26th Air Divisions. The command was inactivated on 23 June 1958 for budgetary reasons, its assigned units being placed under ConAC. First Air Force was reactivated at Stewart Air Force Base, Newburgh, N.Y., on 20 January 1966 due to the inactivation of the ADC Air Defense Sectors. First Air Force assumed responsibility for the ADC 21st, 33d, 34th, 35th, and 36th Air Divisions, primarily located in the northeast and upper Midwest regions of the United States.", "Spacecraft control was provided by a solid-state computer and sequencer and an earth-controlled command system. Attitude control was provided by Sun and Earth sensors, gyroscopes, and pitch and roll jets. The telemetry system aboard the spacecraft consisted of two 960 MHz transmitters, one at 3 W power output and the other at 50 mW power output, the high-gain antenna, and an omnidirectional antenna. White paint, gold and chrome plating, and a silvered plastic sheet encasing the retrorocket furnished thermal control. During prelaunch preparations for Ranger 1, the spacecraft's timer had accidentally been started which led to the deployment of the solar panels inside the payload shroud. It was decided that ground testing of the onboard instruments would not be done on the Block II spacecraft because they had a functional midcourse correction engine and if a similar incident happened with them, the squibs and pyrotechnics used to deploy the solar panels could inadvertently ignite the propellants in the onboard engine, which could result in the explosion of the spacecraft on the pad and possibly take the entire launch vehicle with it. JPL officials announced that factory testing of the Ranger's systems was sufficient to root out any problems and any hardware which failed to pass the tests was not fit to fly.", "1962 robotic lunar exploration mission by NASA; malfunctioned\nRanger 3 was a space exploration mission conducted by NASA to study the Moon. The Ranger 3 robotic spacecraft was launched January 26, 1962 as part of the Ranger program. Due to a series of malfunctions, the spacecraft missed the Moon by and entered a heliocentric orbit. The Ranger 3 space probe was designed to transmit pictures of the lunar surface during a period of 10 minutes of flight prior to impacting on the Moon, to rough-land a seismometer capsule on the Moon, to collect gamma-ray data in flight, to study radar reflectivity of the lunar surface, and to continue testing of the Ranger program for development of lunar and interplanetary spacecraft. Spacecraft design. Ranger 3 was the first of the Block II Ranger designs. The basic vehicle was 3.1 m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsa wood impact-limiter, 635 mm in diameter (25 inches), a mono-propellant mid-course motor, a retrorocket with a thrust of 5080 pounds force (22.6 kN), and a gold- and chrome-plated hexagonal base 1.5 m in diameter. A large high-gain dish antenna was attached to the base. Two wing-like solar panels (5.2 m across) were attached to the base and deployed early in the flight. Power was generated by 8680 solar cells contained in the solar panels which charged an 11.5 kg 1 kW·h capacity AgZn launching and backup battery.", "It also was responsible for the air defense of Greenland, Iceland and parts of Canada. By July 1968, First Air Force had again assumed total responsibility for the air defense of the eastern seaboard, just as it had during World War II. On 16 January 1968 Air Defense Command was re-designated Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM) as part of a restructuring of USAF air defense forces. First Air Force's second period of service was short lived, however, and the command was again inactivated as the result of a major ADCOM reorganization on 31 December 1969 of the First, Fourth, Tenth Air Forces and several Air Divisions. This reorganization was the result of the need to eliminate intermediate levels of command in ADCOM driven by budget reductions and a perceived lessening of the need for continental air defense against attacking Soviet aircraft. ADCOM reassigned the units under the inactivated First Air Force were reassigned primarily to the 20th, 21st or 23d Air Divisions. Tactical Air Command. ADCOM was reorganized on 1 October 1979. The interceptors and warning radars were reassigned to Tactical Air Command (TAC). With this move many Air National Guard units that had an air defense mission also came under the control of TAC, which established a component called Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC), at the level of a numbered air force. On 6 December 1985 HQ USAF reactivated First Air Force at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, and assigned it to Tactical Air Command (TAC), replacing ADTAC.", "She stayed for three years until leaving although returned to the show before it was taken off air in July 1968 as a result of the broadcaster, Associated-Rediffusion, losing their franchise later that month.

The seismometer (code-named \"Tonto\") was encased in the lunar capsule along with an amplifier, a 50 mW transmitter, voltage control, a turnstile antenna, and six silver-cadmium batteries capable of operating the lunar capsule transmitter for 30 days, all designed to land on the Moon at 130 to 160 km/h (80 to 100 mph). The radar altimeter would be used for reflectivity studies, but was also designed to initiate capsule separation and ignite the retrorocket. Mission. This was the first American attempt to achieve impact on the lunar surface. The Block II Ranger spacecraft carried a TV camera that used an optical telescope that would allow imaging down to about 24 kilometers above the lunar surface during the descent. The main bus also carried a 42.6 kilogram instrument capsule that would separate from the bus at 21.4 kilometers altitude and then independently impact on the Moon. Protected by a balsa-wood outer casing, the capsule was designed to bounce several times on the lunar surface before coming to rest. The primary onboard instrument was a seismometer.

A short story collection is distinguished from an anthology of fiction, which would contain work by several authors (e.g., \"Les Soirées de Médan\"). The stories in a collection may or may not share a tone, theme, setting, or characters with one another. Composition of a collection. Short story collections are made up of smaller texts—the individual short stories—in order to form a superior whole. In spite of this, each short story does not lose any of its meaning or narrative independence by being included in a collection. This does not mean that short stories do not gain any new meaning from being included in a collection, though. Because each story's context has changed, surrounded by other stories with their own meanings and tones, the meaning and tone of any individual story might also be affected. In addition to the individual stories, short story collections may also include notes by the author. The act of writing short stories is different from the act of gathering short stories into a collection. For instance, the short story author may or may not be the one who compiles the short story collection, even though the author penned the individual stories. This is especially obvious in the case of posthumous publications. Note that short story collections should be considered different from traditional novels and other narratives because collections do not forward a cohesive storyline in the same way novels do.

The character first appeared in his 1953 novel \"Casino Royale\"; the books are set in a contemporary period during Fleming's lifetime from 1951 to 1964. Fleming wrote twelve novels and two collections of short stories in the series, all at his Jamaican home Goldeneye and published annually. Two of the books were published after Fleming's death in 1964. Since Fleming's death, other authors have written continuation works. Some of these have been novelisations of episodes in the series of \"James Bond\" films, produced by Eon Productions, while others were either continuation novels or short stories. The first author was Kingsley Amis, writing under the pseudonym of Robert Markham, who produced one novel. He was followed by novelist and biographer John Pearson, who wrote a fictional biography of Bond. Novelist and screenwriter Christopher Wood wrote two novelisations in the late 1970s. John Gardner was asked to continue the series by Ian Fleming Publications, the copyright holders to the franchise; he wrote fourteen novels and two novelisations between 1981 and 1996.

Essays have been sub-classified as formal and informal: formal essays are characterized by \"serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length,\" whereas the informal essay is characterized by \"the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme,\" etc. Essays are commonly used as literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been dubbed essays (e.g., Alexander Pope's \"An Essay on Criticism\" and \"An Essay on Man\").

History of short story collections. Short story collections have their roots in medieval frame tale collections, growing into the postmodern narratives of the 1900s. Short story collections either can be authored traditionally by one person or evolve from oral, anonymous traditions that are finally penned by someone. An example of the latter would be \"Grimm's Fairy Tales\". Short story collections can be published when the author is alive or they can be collected and published after the author is dead using the author's existing works. Early Western short story collections include Marie of France's \"Lais\" and Giovanni Boccaccio's \"Decameron.\" Uses for short story collections. From the producer side, short story collections are helpful economically to authors looking to publish. Because short stories are often less than fifty pages, putting them together can provide something that is more like the size of a novel. While short story collections are less popular than novels for consumers, they are purchased consistently. Short story collections have experienced a gradual increase in sales over the last decade, although most collections are not reprinted and do not sell more than 3,000 copies. Aside from their entertainment value, short story collections can also be used for teaching. There are several potential applications for collections in the classroom. The first is the ability for students to quickly experience other cultures and traditions through a literary lens. Secondly, providing short story collections centered around a specific time creates an opportunity to encourage interest in historical studies.", "Geographer, author, and professor at the University of British Columbia\nPhilippe Le Billon is a researcher known for his work in political ecology and on the political economy of war.

Game records.", "Hearing what others are saying, and trying to understand what it means\nListening is giving attention to a sound. When listening, a person hears what others are saying and tries to understand what it means. Listening involves complex affective, cognitive, and behavioral processes. Affective processes include the motivation to listen to others; cognitive processes include attending to, understanding, receiving, and interpreting content and relational messages; and behavioral processes include responding to others with verbal and nonverbal feedback. Listening is a skill for resolving problems. Poor listening can lead to misinterpretations, thus causing conflict or dispute. Poor listening can be exhibited by excessive interruptions, inattention, hearing what you want to hear, mentally composing a response, or having a closed mind. Listening is also linked to memory. According to one study, when there were background noises during a speech, listeners were better able to recall the information in the speech when hearing those noises again. For example, when a person reads or does something else while listening to music, he or she can recall what that was when hearing the music again later. Listening also functions rhetorically as a means of promoting cross-culture communication. What is listening? Listening begins by hearing a speaker producing the sound to be listened to. A semiotician, Roland Barthes, characterized the distinction between listening and hearing. \"Hearing is a physiological phenomenon; listening is a psychological act.\" People are always hearing, most of the time subconsciously. Listening is done by choice. It is the interpretative action taken by someone in order to understand, and potentially make sense of, something they hear."], "distances": [20.919854608091015, 10.216544655595262, 10.053546379571166, 9.923598911896516, 9.385372899739185, 8.669224199820585, 8.617262540186847, 8.404377216479437, 8.171218174470514, 7.64595258539821], "supports": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], "metadatas": [{"mapped_id": "0197e925-80f4-4356-b9c0-faee8b4b0178", "doc_name": "Ondřej Kušnír", "support": 1, "pool_index": 860}, {"mapped_id": "0197e925-80f4-4356-b9c0-faee8b4b0178", "doc_name": "Ondřej", "support": 0, "pool_index": 862}, {"mapped_id": "0f967525-8077-4607-ac6c-56c0734f204e", "doc_name": "Really?

The song originated with his signature comedy routine \"heyeah (here) come da judge\", which featured Markham as a courtroom judge dealing with various legal cases and made a mockery of formal courtroom etiquette. Due to its rhythmic use of boastful rhyming dialogue over a funky drum beat, it is considered a precursor to hip hop music. The song contained background vocals from soul singer Minnie Riperton, who was credited as Andrea Davis when she was recording for Chess Records, the label that released \"Here Comes the Judge\".

Archie Campbell later adapted Markham's routine, performing as \"Justus O'Peace,\" on the country version of \"Laugh-In\", \"Hee Haw\", which borrowed heavily from the minstrel show tradition. Thanks to his \"Heyeah come da judge\" routine, which originally was accompanied by music with a funky beat, Pigmeat Markham is regarded as a forerunner of rap. His song \"Here Comes the Judge\" peaked at number 19 on the \"Billboard\" and other charts in 1968. He published an autobiography, \"Here Come the Judge! \", in the wake of his \"Laugh-In\" success. The song \"Here Comes the Judge\" was prominently sampled by Big Audio Dynamite II in the song \"Rush\". Death. Markham died of a stroke at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx at the age of 77.

He presents the chief with a cane as a gift and symbol of their friendship. Lt. Hunt is promoted due to his personal assistance to Lincoln in arranging the truce. Unhappily, a bigoted superior officer, Col. McComb, and the dastardly Judge Wilcox are opposed to any such treaty. When Hunt states his objection, McComb has him placed under arrest alongside Acoma and a number of Indian braves, also breaking the truce cane.

Though best known as a comedian, Markham was also a singer, dancer, and actor. His nickname came from a stage routine, in which he declared himself to be \"Sweet Poppa Pigmeat\". He was sometimes credited in films as Pigmeat \"Alamo\" Markham. He is also known for his 1968 single \"Here Comes the Judge\", which is often considered to be the earliest hip hop record. Early life and career. Markham was born in Durham, North Carolina. His family was the most prominent on their street, which came to be called (and later officially named) Markham Street in the Hayti District. Markham began his career in traveling music and burlesque shows. For a time he was a member of Bessie Smith's Traveling Revue in the 1920s. Later, he claimed he originated the \"Truckin' \"dance which became nationally popular at the start of the 1930s. In the 1940s he started making film appearances. In 1946 he recorded \"Open the Door, Richard\". Markham was a familiar act at New York's famed Apollo Theater where he wore blackface makeup and huge painted white lips, despite complaints the vaudeville tradition was degrading. The book \"Showtime at the Apollo\" suggests, \"He probably played the Apollo more often than any other performer.\" Starting in the 1950s Pigmeat Markham began appearing on television, making multiple appearances on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\".", "His boisterous, indecorous \"heyeah (here) come da judge\" schtick, which made a mockery of formal courtroom etiquette, became his signature routine. Markham would sit at an elevated judge's bench (often in a black graduation cap-and-gown, to look more impressive), and deal with a series of comic miscreants. He would often deliver his \"judgments\", as well as express frustration with the accused, by leaning over the bench and smacking the accused with an inflated bladder-balloon. He had hit comedy recordings in the 1960s on Chess Records, and saw his routine's entry line become a catchphrase on the \"Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In\" NBC television show, as did his phrase \"Look that up in your Funk &amp; Wagnalls.\" Markham's most famous routine was \"discovered\" by the general public only after Sammy Davis Jr. had performed it as a guest on the March 25, 1968 episode of \"Laugh-In\". Due to the years of racial segregation in the entertainment world, he was not widely known by white audiences, and had almost exclusively performed on the \"Chitlin' Circuit\" of vaudeville, theatres, and night clubs and appeared in several race films, including William D. Alexander's 1949 revue film \"Burlesque in Harlem\", which documented the Chitlin' Circuit.", "He wrote songs and the script, composed music and even directed the play \"Darshanam\" that got him noticed. After Kottayam National Theatres reproduced the play two years later, it became a super hit and Ranganath's career was launched. He wrote 42 plays for various troupes notably \"Sahadarmini\", \"Kudumbakshethram\", \"Amrithasaagaram\", \"Ponnushasinte Varavum Kathu\" and \"Ayalathe Amma\". Later he developed an interest in background score and shifted to Chennai, where he was introduced to films. He entered the film industry by playing orchestra for the popular Malayalam film song \"Naalikerathinte\" from the movie Thurakkatha Vathil. His first film composition was the song \"Oshana Oshana\" for the movie Jesus in 1973. It was P. Jayachandran who suggested HMV to record Ranganath's first stage song. Jayachandran himself sang those songs. So as a gratitude Ranganath called Jayachandran to sing for his first film song. When Ranganath didn't get other opportunities after his first film, he left Chennai, leaving his film dreams behind, and shifted to Kerala and theatre. During this tenure, he got close to K. J.

Originated by Frank Oz and Jim Henson, the characters are currently performed by puppeteers Eric Jacobson and Peter Linz; Oz performed Bert until 1 January 2006. History. Bert and Ernie were built by Don Sahlin from a simple design scribbled by Jim Henson, creator of \"The Muppets\". Initially, Henson performed Bert and Oz performed Ernie, but, after just one day of rehearsal, they switched characters. The original idea was to show that even though two people can have totally different characteristics, they can still be good friends. According to writer Jon Stone, the relationship between Bert and Ernie reflected the real-life friendship between Oz and Henson. Although their names are commonly believed to have been drawn from those of two minor characters in the Frank Capra film \"It's A Wonderful Life\", sources from within the \"Sesame Street\" production team suggest that the identical names were coincidental. According to A&amp;E's \"Biography\", Bert and Ernie were virtually the only Muppets to appear in the \"Sesame Street\" pilot episode, which was screen-tested to a number of families in July 1969.", "In July 2013, \"The New Yorker\" magazine chose an image of Bert and Ernie by artist Jack Hunter, titled \"Moment of Joy\", as the cover of their publication, which covers the Supreme Court decisions on the Defense of Marriage Act and California's Proposition 8. Sesame Workshop was reportedly so outraged by the idea that it was rumored to be considering the possibility of litigation. In September 2018, Mark Saltzman, one of the script and songwriters for \"Sesame Street\", stated in an interview with \"Queerty\" that when he wrote Bert and Ernie, they were often analogues for his own intimate relationship with film editor Arnold Glassman. Sesame Workshop responded by stating that Bert and Ernie have no sexual orientations, because they are puppets. Frank Oz, who previously performed as Bert, stated Bert and Ernie were not gay, saying,\nThey're not, of course, a gay couple. But why that question? Does it really matter? Why the need to define people as only gay? There's much more to a human being than just straightness or gayness. The Gay Star News reported that fans reacted negatively to Sesame Workshop's statement. Frank Oz later tweeted in September 2018:\nA last thought: If Jim and I had created Bert and Ernie as gay characters they would be inauthentic, coming from two straight men. However, I have now learned that many view them as representative of a loving gay relationship. And that's pretty wonderful. Thanks for helping me understand.

From 2014 to 2017, Billy Barkhurst took on the role of Ernie; currently, the character is performed by Peter Linz. Ernie is a spongy \"live hand puppet\", meaning that while operating the head of the puppet with his right hand, the puppeteer inserts his left hand into a T-shaped sleeve, capped off with a glove that matches the fabric \"skin\" of the puppet, thus \"becoming\" the left arm of the puppet. A second puppeteer usually provides the right arm. Ernie's performance of \"Rubber Duckie,\" wherein he sings affectionately about his squeaking toy duck and the joy it brings him during bath time, became a modest mainstream hit, reaching No. 16 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in September 1970. In popular culture. Sexual orientation discussion. Bert and Ernie live together in an apartment located in the basement of 123 Sesame Street. Despite sleeping in separate beds, they share the same bedroom, which has led to some speculation that they are a representation of a gay couple. This has repeatedly been denied by Sesame Workshop, and some of Bert's interactions with female characters do appear to show that he is attracted to women, like serenading Connie Stevens in the \"Some Enchanted Evening\" segment of a first-season episode of \"The Muppet Show\", and recording a song about his girlfriend, \"I Want to Hold Your Ear\", which was released on several albums.", "Their brief appearance was the only part of the pilot that tested well, so it was decided that not only should Muppet characters be the \"stars\" of the show, but they should also interact with the human characters, something that was not done in the pilot. An ordinary Bert and Ernie sketch involves Ernie coming up with a hare-brained idea, and Bert trying to talk him out of it, usually getting Bert frustrated and Ernie dumbfounded. For example, if Ernie wanted to do something loud if Bert is doing something quiet like reading a book or the newspaper, Bert would teach him how to be quiet; however, Ernie would still make some noise, which would cause Bert to either lose his temper or leave the room. \"Sesame Street Live\" performer Taylor Morgan said in an interview that \"I just kind of try to think like a six year old or a seven year old, because that's how old Bert is.\" Bert. Bert was initially performed by Frank Oz. Since 1997, Muppeteer Eric Jacobson has been phased in as Bert's primary performer after Oz retired from most of his Muppet duties to focus on directing. Bert is a foamy and plasticky “hand rod puppet\", which means that while the puppeteer's right arm is inserted into Bert's head to control the mouth, the puppeteer's left hand uses rods to control the arms of the puppet.

Short story collections either can be authored traditionally by one person or evolve from oral, anonymous traditions that are finally penned by someone. An example of the latter would be \"Grimm's Fairy Tales\".

Early Western short story collections include Marie of France's \"Lais\" and Giovanni Boccaccio's \"Decameron.\" Uses for short story collections. From the producer side, short story collections are helpful economically to authors looking to publish. Because short stories are often less than fifty pages, putting them together can provide something that is more like the size of a novel. While short story collections are less popular than novels for consumers, they are purchased consistently. Short story collections have experienced a gradual increase in sales over the last decade, although most collections are not reprinted and do not sell more than 3,000 copies. Aside from their entertainment value, short story collections can also be used for teaching. There are several potential applications for collections in the classroom. The first is the ability for students to quickly experience other cultures and traditions through a literary lens.

Icarus, disregarding one of his father's wishes that he not fly too close to the sun, did just that and melted his way to a feathery demise, drowning in the sea. The other warning from Daedalus was to not fly too close to the sea or the feathers of Icarus' wings would get wet and thus fail.

The lake's banks are bounded by the Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail, and businesses offer recreational watercraft services along the lakefront portion of the trail. Austin's largest downtown park, Zilker Park, is adjacent to the lake, and Barton Springs, a major attraction for swimmers, flows into the lake. The City of Austin prohibits the operation of most motorized watercraft on Lady Bird Lake. As a result, the lake serves as a popular recreational area for paddleboards, kayaks, canoes, dragon boats, and rowing shells. Austin's warm climate and the river's calm waters, nearly length and straight courses are especially popular with crew teams and clubs.

New Mexico has a significant U.S. military presence, including White Sands Missile Range, and strategically valuable federal research centers, such as the Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories. The state hosted several key facilities of the Manhattan Project, which developed the world's first atomic bomb, and was the site of the first nuclear test, Trinity. In prehistoric times, New Mexico was home to Ancestral Puebloans, the Mogollon culture, and ancestral Ute. Navajos and Apaches arrived in the late 15th century and the Comanches in the early 18th century. The Pueblo peoples occupied several dozen villages, primarily in the Rio Grande valley of northern New Mexico. Spanish explorers and settlers arrived in the 16th century from present-day Mexico. Isolated by its rugged terrain, New Mexico was a peripheral part of the viceroyalty of New Spain dominated by Comancheria. Following Mexican independence in 1821, it became an autonomous region of Mexico, albeit increasingly threatened by the centralizing policies of the Mexican government, culminating in the Revolt of 1837; at the same time, the region became more economically dependent on the U.S. Following the Mexican–American War in 1848, the U.S. annexed New Mexico as part of the larger New Mexico Territory.", "It played a central role in U.S. westward expansion and was admitted to the Union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912.

Its large Hispanic population includes Hispanos descended from settlers during the Spanish era, and later groups of Mexican Americans since the 19th century.

The archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico. Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion. Chichén Itzá was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or \"Tollans\", referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.

After the finding of extensive gold deposits in California, the California gold rush started in 1848. Commerce and economic activity in California initially centered around the vastly expanded cities of San Francisco, San Jose, and Sacramento as they scrambled to supply the hordes of gold miners. Meanwhile, Los Angeles initially remained a less populated settlement with fewer than 5,000 residents. Prior to 1850, the government was judged inadequate and poorly run, and statehood status was sought to start trying to remedy this problem. Due to the California Gold Rush, by 1850 California had grown to have a non-Indian and non-Californio population (about 7,000 Californios were residing in California in 1850) of over 110,000. Despite a major conflict in the U.S. Congress on the number of slave versus non-slave states, the large, rapid and continuing California population gains and the large amount of gold being exported east gave California enough clout to choose its own extensive boundaries, elect its representatives and senators, write its Constitution, and be admitted to the Union as a free state in 1850 without going through territorial status as required for most other new states.", "1AF (AFNORTH) is also the designated air component for the United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM).

The methods of retracting and storing the roof vary across eras and manufacturers. A convertible car's design allows an open-air driving experience, with the ability to provide a roof when required. A potential drawback of convertibles is their reduced structural rigidity (requiring significant engineering and modification to counteract the side effects of almost completely removing a car's roof). The majority of convertible roofs are of a folding construction framework with the actual top made from cloth or other fabric. Other types of convertible roofs include retractable hardtops (often constructed from metal or plastic) and detachable hardtops (where a metal or plastic roof is manually removed and often stored in the trunk). Terminology. Other terms for convertibles include cabriolet, cabrio, drop top, drophead coupé, open two-seater, open top, rag top, soft top, spider, and spyder, although companies use many of these terms interchangeably. Thus, nomenclatural consistency is rare. The term cabriolet originated from a carriage cabriolet: \"a light, two-wheeled, one-horse carriage with a folding top, capable of seating two persons\"; however, the term is also used to describe other convertibles. In the United Kingdom, the historical term for a two-door convertible is drophead coupé, and a four-door convertible was called an all-weather tourer. History.", "Most of the early automobiles were open-air vehicles without any roof or sides. As car engines became more powerful by the end of the 19th century, folding textile or leather roofs (as had been used on victoria or landau carriages) began to appear on cars. Examples of early cars with roofs include the phaeton (a two-seat car with a temporary roof), the brougham or a coupé de ville, having an enclosed passenger compartment at the rear, while the driver sat in front either in the open, or the landaulet, where the driver has a fixed roof and the passenger compartment has a folding roof. Less expensive cars, such as the runabouts, sporting roadsters, or sturdy touring cars, remained either completely open air or were fitted with a rudimentary folding top and detachable clear side curtains. In the 1920s, when steel bodies began to be mass-produced, closed cars became available to the average buyer, and fully open cars began to disappear from the mainstream market. By the mid 1930s, the remaining small number of convertibles sold were high-priced luxury models. In 1939, Plymouth introduced the first mechanically operated convertible roof powered by two vacuum cylinders. Demand for convertibles increased as a result of American soldiers in France and the United Kingdom during World War II familiarizing themselves with small roadster cars, which were not available in the United States at that time.

Description. In Greek mythology, Icarus succeeded in flying, with wings made by his father Daedalus, using feathers secured with beeswax. Ignoring his father's warnings, Icarus chose to fly too close to the sun, melting the wax, and fell into the sea and drowned. His legs can be seen in the water just below the ship. The sun, already half-set on the horizon, is a long way away; the flight did not reach anywhere near it.

Drawing heavily from the theories of literary-genre criticism, film genres are usually delineated by \"conventions, iconography, settings, narratives, characters and actors\". One can also classify films by the tone, theme/topic, mood, format, target audience, or budget. These characteristics are most evident in genre films, which are \"commercial feature films [that], through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations\" in a given genre. A film's genre will influence the use of filmmaking styles and techniques, such as the use of flashbacks and low-key lighting in film noir; tight framing in horror films; or fonts that look like rough-hewn logs for the titles of Western films. In addition, genres have associated film scoring conventions, such as lush string orchestras for romantic melodramas or electronic music for science fiction films. Genre also affects how films are broadcast on television, advertised, and organized in video rental stores. Alan Williams distinguishes three main genre categories: narrative, avant-garde, and documentary. With the proliferation of particular genres, film subgenres can also emerge: the legal drama, for example, is a sub-genre of drama that includes courtroom- and trial-focused films.", "The perceived genre of a film can change over time; for example, in the 21st century \"The Great Train Robbery\" (1903) classes as a key early Western film, but when released, marketing promoted it \"for its relation to the then-popular genres of the chase film, the railroad film and the crime film\". A key reason that the early Hollywood industrial system from the 1920s to the 1950s favoured genre films is that in \"Hollywood's industrial mode of production, genre movies are dependable products\" to market to audiences – they were easy to produce and it was easy for audiences to understand a genre film. In the 1920s to 1950s, genre films had clear conventions and iconography, such as the heavy coats worn by gangsters in films like \"Little Caesar\" (1931). The conventions in genre films enable filmmakers to generate them in an industrial, assembly-line fashion, an approach which can be seen in the James Bond spy-films, which all use a formula of \"lots of action, fancy gadgets, beautiful woman and colourful villains\", even though the actors, directors and screenwriters change. Pure and hybrid genres. Films are rarely purely from one genre, which is in keeping with the cinema's diverse and derivative origins, it being a blend of \"vaudeville, music-hall, theatre, photography\" and novels. American film historian Janet Staiger states that the genre of a film can be defined in four ways. The \"idealist method\" judges films by predetermined standards.", "Hydraulic cements (such as Portland cement) are made of a mixture of silicates and oxides, the four main mineral phases of the clinker, abbreviated in the cement chemist notation, being:\nC3S: alite (3CaO·SiO2);\nC2S: belite (2CaO·SiO2);\nC3A: tricalcium aluminate (3CaO·Al2O3) (historically, and still occasionally, called \"celite\");\nC4AF: brownmillerite (4CaO·Al2O3·Fe2O3). The silicates are responsible for the cement's mechanical properties — the tricalcium aluminate and brownmillerite are essential for the formation of the liquid phase during the sintering (firing) process of clinker at high temperature in the kiln. The chemistry of these reactions is not completely clear and is still the object of research. First, the limestone (calcium carbonate) is burned to remove its carbon, producing lime (calcium oxide) in what is known as a calcination reaction. This single chemical reaction is a major emitter of global carbon dioxide emissions. &lt;chem&gt;CaCO3 -&gt; CaO + CO2&lt;/chem&gt;\nThe lime reacts with silicon dioxide to produce dicalcium silicate and tricalcium silicate.", "Film genre\nA female buddy film is a type of buddy film. In these films, women are the main characters and their friendships and relationships with each other drive the story. The plots of female buddy films can share the same concept of male buddy films—opposite personalities go on an adventure or journey of sorts—or they can concern an ensemble group of women. Female buddy films gained popularity in the 1960s from the emergence of the woman's film and the male buddy film genres. Characteristics. The main characters of female buddy films are women, and the film's events center on their situations. The main cast is often female, depending on the plot. Critic Hannah McGill of \"Sight &amp; Sound\" wrote, \"Films that centralise friendship between women and girls are thus always doing something slightly radical, whatever their other themes and content. They repudiate the message that women are adjuncts to men; they emphasise the fact that women and girls still exist when there are no men or boys in the room.\" Background. The buddy film was historically a genre limited to men and rooted in the literature and culture of America, with the fictional portrayal of male bonding in the United States tracing back to 19th-century author Mark Twain's characters Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, as well as Huck and Jim in \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\". The occurrence of one woman interacting with another in film was so rare that concepts like the Bechdel test originated as a means of measuring the representation of women in fiction.", "The concept of an \"essay\" has been extended to other media beyond writing. A film essay is a movie that often incorporates documentary filmmaking styles and focuses more on the evolution of a theme or idea. A photographic essay covers a topic with a linked series of photographs that may have accompanying text or captions. Definitions. The word \"essay\" derives from the French infinitive , \"to try\" or \"to attempt\". In English \"essay\" first meant \"a trial\" or \"an attempt\", and this is still an alternative meaning. The Frenchman Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) was the first author to describe his work as essays; he used the term to characterize these as \"attempts\" to put his thoughts into writing. Subsequently, \"essay\" has been defined in a variety of ways. One definition is a \"prose composition with a focused subject of discussion\" or a \"long, systematic discourse\". It is difficult to define the genre into which essays fall. Aldous Huxley, a leading essayist, gives guidance on the subject. He notes that \"the essay is a literary device for saying almost everything about almost anything\", and adds that \"by tradition, almost by definition, the essay is a short piece\". Furthermore, Huxley argues that \"essays belong to a literary species whose extreme variability can be studied most effectively within a three-poled frame of reference\".", "Subgenres are often a mixture of two separate genres; genres can also merge with seemingly unrelated ones to form hybrid genres, where popular combinations include the romantic comedy and the action comedy film. Broader examples include the docufiction and docudrama, which merge the basic categories of fiction and non-fiction (documentary). Genres are not fixed; they change and evolve over time, and some genres may largely disappear (for example, the melodrama). Not only does \"genre\" refer to a type of film or its category, a key role is also played by the expectations of an audience about a film, as well as institutional discourses that create generic structures. Overview. Characteristics. Characteristics of particular genres are most evident in genre films, which are \"commercial feature films [that], through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations\" in a given genre. Drawing heavily from the theories of literary-genre criticism, film genres are usually delineated by conventions, iconography, narratives, formats, characters, and actors, all of which can vary according to the genre. In terms of standard or \"stock\" characters, those in film noir, for example, include the femme fatale and the \"hardboiled\" detective; while those in Westerns, stock characters include the schoolmarm and the gunslinger. Regarding actors, some may acquire a reputation linked to a single genre, such as John Wayne (the Western) or Fred Astaire (the musical)."], "distances": [13.59038065090754, 13.252046286605951, 12.07773280620712, 12.07773280620712, 11.139899294865357, 11.027909487312137, 10.327564646109508, 10.151253181889071, 10.019253598565461, 9.954256589254156], "supports": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "metadatas": [{"mapped_id": "06b1b417-0635-4334-94bc-b7615613f919", "doc_name": "Landscape with the Fall of Icarus", "support": 0, "pool_index": 1862}, {"mapped_id": "0ea4a84b-3770-4618-a040-2e59c0e24c03", "doc_name": "Genre (1996 film)", "support": 1, "pool_index": 405}, {"mapped_id": "0189c0a8-88a8-4785-a639-b0904cde3f2f", "doc_name": "Short story", "support": 0, "pool_index": 953}, {"mapped_id": "0873c590-a12a-4f5d-bc58-1ebc0e27152e", "doc_name": "Short story", "support": 0, "pool_index": 977}, {"mapped_id": "0ea4a84b-3770-4618-a040-2e59c0e24c03", "doc_name": "Film genre", "support": 0, "pool_index": 406}, {"mapped_id": "0ea4a84b-3770-4618-a040-2e59c0e24c03", "doc_name": "Film genre", "support": 0, "pool_index": 409}, {"mapped_id": "0fe811b4-7208-4f0c-86d2-c3d804966cdc", "doc_name": "Cement", "support": 0, "pool_index": 719}, {"mapped_id": "064967bf-ff06-4216-97b7-385e05a6bafe", "doc_name": "Female buddy film", "support": 0, "pool_index": 429}, {"mapped_id": "087516fc-e840-4ef5-b8a7-950dd55dd043", "doc_name": "Essay", "support": 0, "pool_index": 994}, {"mapped_id": "0ea4a84b-3770-4618-a040-2e59c0e24c03", "doc_name": "Film genre", "support": 0, "pool_index": 407}], "recall": 1.0, "precision": 0.1, "ndcg": 0.6309297535714575, "mrr": 0.5}

The packaging of \"An Ideal for Living\"—which featured a drawing of a Hitler Youth member on the cover—coupled with the nature of the band's name fuelled speculation about their political affiliations. While Hook and Sumner later said they were intrigued by fascism at the time, Morris believed that the group's dalliance with Nazi imagery came from a desire to keep memories of the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents during World War II alive. He argued that accusations of neo-Nazi sympathies merely provoked the band \"to keep on doing it, because that's the kind of people we are\".

The group consisted of vocalist, guitarist and lyricist Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. Sumner and Hook formed the band after attending a June 1976 Sex Pistols concert. While Joy Division's first recordings were heavily influenced by early punk rock, they soon developed a sparse sound and style that made them one of the pioneering groups of the post-punk genre and movement. Their self-released 1978 debut EP \"An Ideal for Living\" drew the attention of the Manchester television personality Tony Wilson, who signed them to his independent label Factory Records. Their debut album \"Unknown Pleasures\", recorded with producer Martin Hannett, was released in 1979. Curtis struggled with personal problems, including a failing marriage, depression, and epilepsy. As the band's popularity grew, Curtis's health condition made it increasingly difficult for him to perform; he occasionally experienced seizures on stage. He died by suicide on the eve of what would have been the band's first North American tour in May 1980, aged 23. Joy Division's second and final album, \"Closer\", was released two months later; it and the single \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" became their highest-charting releases. Between July and October 1980, the remaining members, with the addition of keyboardist and guitarist Gillian Gilbert, regrouped under the name New Order.

Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join the Panik, and even had Curtis audition. On 18 July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions. Driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off. In August 1977, Warsaw placed an advertisement in a music shop window seeking a replacement drummer. Stephen Morris, who had attended the same school as Curtis, was the sole respondent. Deborah Curtis, Ian's wife, stated that Morris \"fitted perfectly\" with the band, and that with his addition Warsaw became a \"complete 'family'\". To avoid confusion with the London punk band Warsaw Pakt, the band renamed themselves Joy Division in early 1978, borrowing the name from the sexual slavery wing of a Nazi concentration camp mentioned in the 1955 novel \"House of Dolls\".

Diane wrote songs for Gene Autry in the 1950s and scored a hit in 1976 when Asleep at the Wheel covered her 1950 demo \"Miles and Miles of Texas\". After serving in the U.S. Navy, Johnston returned to Fort Worth, Texas, where he and his mother collaborated on songwriting for rockabilly artist Mac Curtis and others. From 1956 to 1961, Johnston recorded a few rockabilly singles under the name Don Johnston. He married songwriter Joy Byers with whom he began to collaborate. In later years, Johnston claimed that songs still credited to his wife Joy Byers were actually co-written, or solely written by himself. He has cited old \"contractual reasons\" for this situation. The songs in question include Timi Yuro's 1962 hit \"What's A Matter Baby\", plus at least 16 songs for Elvis Presley's films between 1964 and 1968, including \"It Hurts Me\", \"Let Yourself Go\", and \"Stop, Look and Listen\".

The internal provincial borders of British India were a result of historical events, as well as political, military and strategic planning by the British. The Government agreed that the reorganisation of state borders was necessary, but the basis of reorganisation was yet to be determined. One of the proposals was to reorganise the state on the basis of languages of India. This would make administration easier, and would help replace the caste and religion-based identities with less controversial linguistic identities. Earlier in 1920, the members of the Indian National Congress had agreed on the linguistic reorganisation of the Indian states as one of the party's political goals.

The stories in a collection may or may not share a tone, theme, setting, or characters with one another. Composition of a collection. Short story collections are made up of smaller texts—the individual short stories—in order to form a superior whole. In spite of this, each short story does not lose any of its meaning or narrative independence by being included in a collection. This does not mean that short stories do not gain any new meaning from being included in a collection, though. Because each story's context has changed, surrounded by other stories with their own meanings and tones, the meaning and tone of any individual story might also be affected. In addition to the individual stories, short story collections may also include notes by the author. The act of writing short stories is different from the act of gathering short stories into a collection. For instance, the short story author may or may not be the one who compiles the short story collection, even though the author penned the individual stories. This is especially obvious in the case of posthumous publications. Note that short story collections should be considered different from traditional novels and other narratives because collections do not forward a cohesive storyline in the same way novels do.

The protagonist of the series, James Bond, is a British Secret Service agent, often referred to by his code name 007. The character first appeared in his 1953 novel \"Casino Royale\"; the books are set in a contemporary period during Fleming's lifetime from 1951 to 1964. Fleming wrote twelve novels and two collections of short stories in the series, all at his Jamaican home Goldeneye and published annually. Two of the books were published after Fleming's death in 1964. Since Fleming's death, other authors have written continuation works. Some of these have been novelisations of episodes in the series of \"James Bond\" films, produced by Eon Productions, while others were either continuation novels or short stories. The first author was Kingsley Amis, writing under the pseudonym of Robert Markham, who produced one novel. He was followed by novelist and biographer John Pearson, who wrote a fictional biography of Bond. Novelist and screenwriter Christopher Wood wrote two novelisations in the late 1970s. John Gardner was asked to continue the series by Ian Fleming Publications, the copyright holders to the franchise; he wrote fourteen novels and two novelisations between 1981 and 1996.

Essays have been sub-classified as formal and informal: formal essays are characterized by \"serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length,\" whereas the informal essay is characterized by \"the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme,\" etc. Essays are commonly used as literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been dubbed essays (e.g., Alexander Pope's \"An Essay on Criticism\" and \"An Essay on Man\"). While brevity usually defines an essay, voluminous works like John Locke's \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" and Thomas Malthus's \"An Essay on the Principle of Population\" are counterexamples. In some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays have become a major part of formal education.

Short story collections either can be authored traditionally by one person or evolve from oral, anonymous traditions that are finally penned by someone. An example of the latter would be \"Grimm's Fairy Tales\". Short story collections can be published when the author is alive or they can be collected and published after the author is dead using the author's existing works. Early Western short story collections include Marie of France's \"Lais\" and Giovanni Boccaccio's \"Decameron.\" Uses for short story collections. From the producer side, short story collections are helpful economically to authors looking to publish. Because short stories are often less than fifty pages, putting them together can provide something that is more like the size of a novel. While short story collections are less popular than novels for consumers, they are purchased consistently. Short story collections have experienced a gradual increase in sales over the last decade, although most collections are not reprinted and do not sell more than 3,000 copies. Aside from their entertainment value, short story collections can also be used for teaching. There are several potential applications for collections in the classroom. The first is the ability for students to quickly experience other cultures and traditions through a literary lens.

Sarah McLachlan said that writing it was easy, \"a real joyous occasion\", and that \"the bulk of it came in about three hours\". It was inspired by articles that she read in \"Rolling Stone\" about musicians turning to heroin to cope with the pressures of the music industry and subsequently overdosing, most notably Jonathan Melvoin, a keyboardist for the Smashing Pumpkins, who died of an overdose in 1996. She said that she identified with the feelings that might lead someone to use heroin: \"I've been in that place where you've messed up and you're so lost that you don't know who you are anymore, and you're miserable—and here's this escape route. I've never done heroin, but I've done plenty of other things to escape.\" She said that the song is about \"trying not to take responsibility for other people's problems and trying to love yourself at the same time\". Composition. The song has a sparse arrangement, with only three instruments used: a piano played by McLachlan, a drum machine programmed by Pierre Marchand, and upright bass played by Jim Creeggan of Barenaked Ladies. It was recorded in the key of D-flat major. For live performances, it is transposed up one half-step to D major, the key it was originally written in, and played without the bass.

It is owned by Gray Television alongside dual NBC/Telemundo affiliate KHNL (channel 13) and Kailua-Kona–licensed KFVE (channel 6), which relays KHNL's second and sixth digital subchannels. The stations share studios on Waiakamilo Road in Honolulu's Kapālama neighborhood; KGMB's transmitter is located in Akupu, Hawaii. History. The station first signed on the air on December 1, 1952, as the second television station in Hawaii. KGMB-TV was originally owned by J. Howard Worrall along with KGMB radio (AM 590, now KSSK) and operated from studios on Kapiolani Boulevard in Honolulu. The station carried programming from three of the four major networks at the time (excluding DuMont), but was a primary CBS affiliate owing to KGMB-AM's long affiliation with CBS Radio. The station lost NBC programming when KONA-TV (channel 2, now KHON-TV) signed on two weeks later, and lost ABC when KULA-TV (channel 4, now KITV) launched in April 1954. In 1973, a partnership led by future Hawaii congressman Cecil Heftel bought KGMB-AM-TV, then turned around and sold the KGMB stations to Lee Enterprises in 1977. Lee sold off the radio station in 1980.", "In 1982, the station dropped the \"-TV\" suffix from its call sign. The real-life KGMB news crew was often featured in one of the longest-running police dramas on CBS in the 1970s, \"Hawaii Five-O\". The station also had ties to the iconic series' reboot, as CBS allowed KGMB to let its viewers preview the season premiere episode early at the Waikiki Shell each September during the rebooted series' run. In 2000, Lee exited from television broadcasting and sold most of its television holdings (including KGMB) to Emmis Communications. Emmis already owned KHON-TV, so it had to obtain a cross-ownership waiver for the purchase of KGMB from the Federal Communications Commission, to bypass the recently passed duopoly rules that forbid common ownership of two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market. This waiver was renewed several times while Emmis owned both stations. At that time, KHON moved its operations into KGMB's facility, though the two stations maintained separate news departments. From September 2, 2002, to October 31, 2004, KGMB carried select UPN programming via a secondary affiliation shared with KHON; each station aired programs from that network that the other station did not air. The two stations began carrying UPN programming in September 2002 after KFVE (which had been with UPN since its January 1995 launch) disaffiliated from the network to become a full-time affiliate of The WB (whose programming aired on KFVE in a secondary capacity since December 1998).", "Later, with an emphasis on weather, the station branded itself \"Hawaii's Severe Weather Station\". Channel swap. On August 18, 2009, MCG Capital and Raycom Media (owner of KHNL and, at the time, KFVE) announced a shared services agreement with Raycom as senior partner. As part of the deal, KGMB vacated its longtime studios on Kapiolani Boulevard; the combined operation would be based at KHNL/KFVE's studios on Waiakamilo Road. Though non-news programming would remain in place, news operations of the three stations would be combined into a single entity. The arrangement would also see a channel swap, with KGMB moving from virtual channel 9 (UHF digital channel 23) to channel 5 (UHF digital channel 22) and KFVE move from 5 to 9. The resulting ownership arrangement of the stations generated some controversy, as it had the effect of Raycom trading KFVE to MCG Capital in return for KGMB. Organizations such as media watchdog group Media Council Hawaii viewed the plan as a way to circumvent FCC rules preventing one company owning two of the four highest-rated stations in the same market—in this case, KGMB and KHNL. However, the FCC only recognizes ownership of facility identifications, which remain attached to their channel numbers, and not ownership of a station's intellectual unit (call letters, programming, network affiliation, etc.).", "In addition, the station also shared ABC programming with CBS affiliate KSL-TV (channel 5, now an NBC affiliate) until KUTV (channel 2) signed on in September 1954 as a full-time ABC affiliate. KTVX is the oldest television station located in the Mountain Time Zone and the third oldest station located west of the Mississippi River. It was also the first independently owned television station to sign-on in the United States. The station changed its call letters to KTVT in 1954 (the KTVT call letters are now used on the CBS owned-and-operated station in Dallas–Fort Worth). Its call letters later changed to KCPX-TV in 1959 following its sale to Screen Gems Broadcasting (a division of Screen Gems, then the television division of Columbia Pictures). Some notable local programs during channel 4's early years included the children's programs \"Hotel Balderdash\" (which debuted on September 11, 1972) and \"Fireman Frank\", and horror film showcase \"Nightmare Theater\", the latter two programs were both hosted by Ron Ross. At this time, the station was using an \"Open 4\" logo that was later implemented by WAPA-TV in San Juan, Puerto Rico (that station used several variations of the logo from the 1970s until implementing a new logo in 1987). The station swapped affiliations with KUTV in 1960 and became an ABC affiliate. KTVX by then had become the first television station in Utah to broadcast in color and was one of the first ABC affiliates to broadcast in color.", "KIKU, an independent station specializing in Japanese programming, became a secondary UPN affiliate on November 1, 2004, and remained with the network until its closure on September 15, 2006. Emmis itself prepared to exit the television industry and sold KHON to the Montecito Broadcast Group in 2006. Emmis then announced on February 20, 2007, that KGMB and its satellites had been sold to MCG Capital Corporation for $40 million, resulting in one of the rare instances involving a complete separation of a television station duopoly. The FCC approved the sale in late May and was completed on June 4, 2007. Shortly after MCG Capital Corporation took over, KGMB adopted a logo similar to the one it used in the early 1980s and also rolled out a new graphics package for its newscast and a new website. For many years, KGMB billed itself as \"One of the Good Things About Hawaii\" with its rich history of local television programming exclusively in Hawaii, especially in such shows as \"Skipper Al\" and \"Checkers &amp; Pogo\" (both children's programs; the latter being the most remembered, airing from 1967 to 1982 and featured Morgan White), \"The Hawaii Moving Company\" (originally a disco/dance program that transitioned into a general interest show), and the 1982 television special \"Rap's Hawaii\" starring Rap Reiplinger. This slogan was made famous by an \"a cappella\" jingle which is still heard on KGMB today. At the end of KGMB's morning newscast, \"Sunrise\", it can now be heard leading into \"CBS Mornings\".", "American sketch comedy television series\nFriends of the People is an American sketch comedy television series. It was slated to premiere on TruTV in summer 2014, but was pushed to October 28, 2014, as part of the network's shift in their programming direction. Many of the cast members (Jennifer Bartels, Jermaine Fowler, and Lil Rel Howery) were originally reported to be cast members of a planned revival of \"In Living Color\" which never materialized. The show's first season consisted of 10 episodes. This made it the network's first sketch comedy show. The series held a TV-14 rating, though select episodes were rated TV-MA — also a first for the truTV network.

In 1981, United Television merged with Chris-Craft Industries. In late 1994, CBS and Westinghouse Broadcasting announced a complex ownership trade with NBC. KUTV and KCNC-TV in Denver, which were owned by NBC at the time (the former station had recently been purchased by the network), were traded to Westinghouse in exchange for WCAU in Philadelphia; this came about after Westinghouse signed an affiliation deal with CBS which would cause KYW-TV and two other stations to switch to the network. NBC approached KTVX for an affiliation deal, but the station would renew its affiliation contract with ABC; as a result, it signed an affiliation deal with KSL-TV, which took effect on September 10, 1995. Chris-Craft's television stations were sold to Fox Television Stations (a subsidiary of News Corporation) on August 12, 2000, which was finalized July 31, 2001. Since Fox already owned KSTU (channel 13), it was forced to sell KTVX due to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations prohibiting one company from owning two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market, as well as the fact that the station was in the middle of a long-term affiliation contract with ABC.", "In this case, Raycom kept ownership of Facility ID 34445, now belonging to KGMB, while MCG Capital still owns Facility ID 36917, which now belonged to KFVE; the overall viewership of channel 5, as KFVE, fell outside the criteria that would have otherwise barred a duopoly between KHNL and KGMB if facility IDs were traded as well. Raycom Media president Paul McTear staunchly defended the SSA, stating it would \"preserve three stations that provide important and valuable local, national and international programming to viewers in Hawaii.\" Further controversy over the SSA grew after a November 7, 2009, report in the \"Honolulu Star-Bulletin\" revealed that Raycom would pay MCG Capital Corporation $22 million (according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission) – which, in effect, would constitute a sale of KGMB from MCG Capital to Raycom. Both companies did not mention any monetary exchanges during its August SSA announcement, only \"assets\". The FCC, in response to Media Council Hawaii's filing of an objection over the SSA, asked Raycom for detailed, unredacted agreements in relation to the SSA. The SSA and channel swap took effect on October 26, 2009, with KGMB moving from virtual channel 9 to channel 5 and changing its branding from \"KGMB 9\" to just \"KGMB.\" An estimated 68 positions from a total of 198 between the three stations would be eliminated as part of the agreement.", "1969 American children's television series\nH.R. Pufnstuf is an American children's television series created by Sid and Marty Krofft.

The seventeen episodes were originally broadcast Saturday from September 6, 1969, to December 27, 1969. The broadcasts were successful enough that NBC kept it on the schedule as reruns until September 4, 1971. The show was shot at Paramount Studios and its opening was shot at Big Bear Lake, California. Reruns of the show returned on ABC Saturday morning from September 2, 1972, to September 8, 1973, and on Sunday mornings in some markets from September 16, 1973, to September 8, 1974. It was syndicated by itself from September 1974 to June 1978 and in a package with six other Krofft series under the banner \"Krofft Superstars\" from 1978 to 1985. Reruns of the show were featured on TV Land in 1999 as part of its Super Retrovision Saturdaze Saturday morning-related overnight prime programming block and in the summer of 2004 as part of its TV Land Kitschen weekend late-night prime programming block, and it was later shown on MeTV from 2014 until 2016.

KTVX was the only Chris-Craft owned station to have no affiliation with UPN during the time that the company owned a partial stake in the network. In August 2005, President George W. Bush visited Salt Lake City to speak to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Cindy Sheehan appeared in a paid political message protesting the Iraq War and the ad was submitted to the four major network stations in the market (KSL-TV, KSTU, KTVX and KUTV). KTVX management declined the offer saying that \"the content could very well be offensive to our community in Utah, which has contributed more than its fair share of fighting soldiers and suffered significant loss of life in this Iraq war.\" On November 16, 2006, Clear Channel announced plans to sell all of its television stations, including KTVX, after being bought by private equity firms. On April 20, 2007, Clear Channel sold its television station group to Providence Equity Partners's Newport Television. That company closed on the station group on March 14, 2008.

Between 1591 and 1597 he was music director at the cathedral and seminary in Magliano Capo di Sabina. He disappears from the record after 1597, but a book of newly composed chansons by him, published in Antwerp that year, has suggested that he may have again returned to the land of his birth. Music. All of Rinaldo del Mel's surviving music is vocal, and it is both sacred and secular. He was a prolific composer, and wrote both motets and madrigals, as well as some forms that blended elements of the sacred and secular, such as a collection of \"spiritual canzonets\". His style shows the craftsmanship of an exceptional Netherlandish musical training, as well as the influence of Palestrina, who was probably his teacher, as claimed by Baini. Mel's sacred music, as would be expected of a composer of the Roman School, is more conservative stylistically than his secular music. Since his music is yet to appear in a modern edition it has not been fully evaluated by scholars. Mel wrote several sets of cyclic madrigals, i.e. sets of madrigals which set successive stanzas of a long poem (Monteverdi's \"Sestina: Lagrime d'Amante al Sepolcro dell'Amata\" is probably the most famous example of a cyclic madrigal set).", "Franco-Flemish composer\nRinaldo del Mel (also René del Mel, del Melle) (probably 1554 – c. 1598) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance, mainly active in Italy, and a member of the Roman School of composition.

Mel was born in Mechelen to an aristocratic family closely connected to the Duchy of Lorraine; his father was in charge of the financial management of the Duke's estate. In 1562, at the probable age of eight, he began study at the Cathedral of St. Rombaut, with Séverin Cornet being his principal teacher. In 1572, after finishing his schooling, he was sent to Lisbon by his family, where he may have served as \"maestro di cappella\" at the court (according to Giuseppe Baini, the 19th century writer on music, who was not always a reliable source). By 1580 he was in Rome, possibly studying with Palestrina. Records indicate he was at Chieti in 1583, and in January 1584 in Venice; in July of that year he accepted a position as \"maestro di cappella\" at Rieti Cathedral, but was dismissed shortly thereafter for being too often absent from his duties. Between 1585 and 1591 Mel traveled widely, returning to Flanders, including Liège and Antwerp.

Mel's settings show some progressive tendencies, such as an increasing melodic emphasis on the uppermost part, a feature which foreshadowed the polarization of soprano and bass parts that was a feature of the Baroque style several decades later. In addition, in his secular music he often employs harmonic progressions with root motions in fifths, another feature of the Baroque style to follow. Another stylistic aspect of his madrigals is the prominent use of textural contrast, with chordal, syllabic passages alternating with passages in running thirds or sixths, or brief imitative sections.

Porky shared his stutter with the voice actor who originally played him, Joe Dougherty, who was actually a person who stuttered. Because Dougherty could not control his stutter, however, production costs became too high as his recording sessions took hours, and Porky's additional lines were done by Count Cutelli. Mel Blanc replaced Dougherty in 1937. Blanc continued the stutter; however, it was harnessed for a more precise comedic effect (such as stumbling over a simple word only to substitute a longer word without difficulty, or vice versa). This is parodied in \"A Connecticut Rabbit in King Arthur's Court\", where Bugs Bunny struggles to pronounce the word \"porcupine\", which Porky pronounces with no trouble. \"Porky's Duck Hunt\" was released in 1937, and Blanc officially became the permanent voice of Porky until his death in 1989.

Its name is associated with the mythical condition of lycanthropy, a supernatural affliction in which humans are said to physically shapeshift into wolves. The term is used by researchers mostly in the broader sense of transformation into animals in general, that, strictly speaking, is described as zoanthropy. Signs and symptoms. Affected individuals believe that they are in the process of transforming into an animal, or have already transformed into an animal. Clinical Lycanthropy has been associated with the altered states of mind that accompany psychosis, the mental state that typically involves delusions and hallucinations, with the transformation only seeming to happen in the mind and behavior of the affected person. A 1988 study on clinical lycanthropy from the McLean Hospital reported on a series of cases, and proposed some diagnostic criteria by which clinical lycanthropy could be recognised:\nAccording to these criteria, either a delusional belief in current or past transformation or behavior that suggests a person thinks of themselves as transformed is considered evidence of clinical lycanthropy. The authors note that, although the condition seems to be an expression of psychosis, there is no specific diagnosis of mental or neurological illness associated with its behavioral consequences. Clinical lycanthropy is not specific to an experience of human-to-wolf transformation.", "However, there are suggestions that certain neurological conditions and cultural influences may result in the expression of the human-animal transformation theme that defines the condition. Neurological factors. One important factor may be differences or changes in parts of the brain known to be involved in representing body shape (e.g., see proprioception and body image). A neuroimaging study of two people diagnosed with clinical lycanthropy showed that these areas display unusual activation, suggesting that when people report their bodies are changing shape, they may be genuinely perceiving those feelings. Treatment. Because clinical lycanthropy is strongly associated with psychotic disorders, antipsychotic medication is often an effective treatment. It may also be treated with antidepressants or mood stabilizers, in cases in which it is a symptom of depression or bipolar disorder. Patients with clinical lycanthropy may also benefit from a cultural approach to treatment, as the syndrome is generally agreed to be culture-bound. Related disorders. Clinical lycanthropy is a type of delusional misidentification syndrome of the self, and it often overlaps with other delusional misidentification syndromes. For example, there is a case study of a psychiatric patient who had both clinical lycanthropy and Cotard delusion. In rare cases, individuals may believe that other people have transformed into animals. This has been termed \"lycanthropic intermetamorphosis\" and \"lycanthropy spectrum.\"", "A wide variety of creatures have been reported as part of the shape-shifting experience. A 2004 review of the medical literature lists over thirty published cases of clinical lycanthropy, only the minority of which have wolf (Lycanthropy) or dog (Cynanthropy) themes. Canines are certainly not uncommon, although the experience of being transformed into other animals such as a hyena, cat, horse, bird, or tiger has been reported on more than one occasion. Transformation into frogs, and even bees, has been reported in some instances. The term \"ophidianthropy\" refers to the delusion that one has been transformed into a snake, of which two case studies have been reported. In Japan, transformation into foxes and dogs was common (, ). A 1989 case study described how one individual reported a serial transformation, experiencing a change from human to dog, to a horse, and then to a cat, before returning to the reality of human existence after treatment. There are also reports of people who experienced transformation into an animal only listed as \"unspecified.\" Proposed mechanisms. Clinical lycanthropy is a very rare condition and is largely considered to be an idiosyncratic expression of a psychotic or dissociative episode caused by another condition such as Dissociative Identity Disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or clinical depression. It has also been associated with drug intoxication and withdrawal, cerebrovascular disease, traumatic brain injury, dementia, delirium, and seizures.", "Listening differs from obeying. A person who receives and understands information or an instruction, and then chooses not to comply with it or not to agree to it, has listened to the speaker, even though the result is not what the speaker wanted. How does one listen? Listening may be considered as a simple and isolated process, but it would be more precise to perceive it as a complex and systematic process. It involves the perception of sounds made by the speaker, of intonation patterns that focus on the information, and of the relevance of the topic under discussion. People listen for 45 percent of their time when they communicate. According to Barthes, listening can be understood on three levels: alerting, deciphering, and understanding how the sound is produced and how it affects the listener. All three levels of listening , and sometimes all at once. The second and third levels overlap and intertwine, in that obtaining, understanding, and deriving meaning are part of the same process. In this way anyone, on hearing a doorknob turn (obtaining), can almost automatically assume that someone is at the door (deriving meaning). Active listening. \"Active listening\" involves listening to what is being said and attempting to understand it. It can be described in many ways. Active listening requires that the listener be attentive, nonjudgmental, and non-interrupting. An active listener analyzes what the speaker is saying for its implicature or subtext as well as for meanings contained explicitly in the verbal communication.", "Hearing what others are saying, and trying to understand what it means\nListening is giving attention to a sound. When listening, a person hears what others are saying and tries to understand what it means. Listening involves complex affective, cognitive, and behavioral processes. Affective processes include the motivation to listen to others; cognitive processes include attending to, understanding, receiving, and interpreting content and relational messages; and behavioral processes include responding to others with verbal and nonverbal feedback. Listening is a skill for resolving problems. Poor listening can lead to misinterpretations, thus causing conflict or dispute. Poor listening can be exhibited by excessive interruptions, inattention, hearing what you want to hear, mentally composing a response, or having a closed mind. Listening is also linked to memory. According to one study, when there were background noises during a speech, listeners were better able to recall the information in the speech when hearing those noises again. For example, when a person reads or does something else while listening to music, he or she can recall what that was when hearing the music again later. Listening also functions rhetorically as a means of promoting cross-culture communication. What is listening? Listening begins by hearing a speaker producing the sound to be listened to. A semiotician, Roland Barthes, characterized the distinction between listening and hearing. \"Hearing is a physiological phenomenon; listening is a psychological act.\" People are always hearing, most of the time subconsciously. Listening is done by choice. It is the interpretative action taken by someone in order to understand, and potentially make sense of, something they hear.", "This notion of superstitious practices is not causally related to the outcomes. Both Vyse and Martin argue that what is considered superstitious varies across cultures and time. For Vyse, \"if a culture has not yet adopted science as its standard, then what we consider magic or superstition is more accurately the local science or religion.\" Dale points out that superstitions are often considered out of place in modern times and are influenced by modern science and its notions of what is rational or irrational, surviving as remnants of older popular beliefs and practices. Vyse proposes that in addition to being irrational and culturally dependent, superstitions have to be instrumental; an actual effect is expected by the person holding a belief, such as increased odds of winning a prize. This distinction excludes practices where participants merely expect to be entertained. Alternative religious beliefs as superstition. Religious practices that differ from commonly accepted religions in a given culture are sometimes called superstitious; similarly, new practices brought into an established religious community can also be labeled as superstitious in an attempt to exclude them. Also, an excessive display of devoutness has often been labelled as superstitious behavior. In antiquity, the Latin term \"superstitio\", like its equivalent Greek \"deisidaimonia\", came to be associated with exaggerated ritual and a credulous attitude towards prophecies. Greek and Roman polytheists, who modeled their relations with the gods on political and social terms, scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods, as a slave feared a cruel and capricious master.", "Identification for a good or service\nA brand is a name, term, design, symbol or any other feature that distinguishes one seller's good or service from those of other sellers. Brands are used in business, marketing, and advertising for recognition and, importantly, to create and store value as brand equity for the object identified, to the benefit of the brand's customers, its owners and shareholders. Brand names are sometimes distinguished from generic or store brands. The practice of branding—in the original literal sense of marking by burning—is thought to have begun with the ancient Egyptians, who are known to have engaged in livestock branding and branded slaves as early as 2,700 BCE. Branding was used to differentiate one person's cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal's skin with a hot branding iron. If a person stole any of the cattle, anyone else who saw the symbol could deduce the actual owner. The term has been extended to mean a strategic personality for a product or company, so that \"brand\" now suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into. Over time, the practice of branding objects extended to a broader range of packaging and goods offered for sale including oil, wine, cosmetics, and fish sauce and, in the 21st century, extends even further into services (such as legal, financial and medical), political parties and people's stage names.", "The marketing research process is a six-step process involving the definition of the problem being studied upon, determining what approach to take, formulation of research design, field work entailed, data preparation and analysis, and the generation of reports, how to present these reports, and overall, how the task can be accomplished.

In defining the problem, the researcher should take into account the \"purpose of the study\", \"relevant background information and all necessary data\", and how the information gathered will be used in decision making. Problem definition involves discussion with the decision makers, interviews with industry experts, analysis of secondary data, and, perhaps, some qualitative research, such as focus groups. Once the problem has been precisely defined, the research can be designed and conducted properly. \"Development of an approach to the problem\" is the second step. This includes formulating an objective or theoretical framework, constructing analytical models, generating research questions, hypotheses, and identifying characteristics or factors that can influence the research design.

The US is ranked first in crop export volume; almost 50% of its total wheat production is exported. The United States Department of Agriculture defines eight official classes of wheat: durum wheat, hard red spring wheat, hard red winter wheat, soft red winter wheat, hard white wheat, soft white wheat, unclassed wheat, and mixed wheat. Winter wheat accounts for 70 to 80 percent of total production in the US, with the largest amounts produced in Kansas (10.8 million tons) and North Dakota (9.8 million tons). The US hard red spring wheat crop is exported to over 70 countries each year to the extent of 55%. Of the total wheat produced in the country, 50% is exported, valued at US$9 billion. History. According to Ricardo Alegria, wheat was first cultivated in New Spain by afro-spanish conquistador Juan Garrido in the 16th century. Although it was first introduced to the Western Hemisphere following the discovery of the New World, wheat came to be grown in North American soil only during the colonial period. During the colonial period, wheat was sown by broadcasting, reaped by sickles, and threshed by flails. The kernels were then taken to a grist mill for grinding into flour.", "It is not known whether the unapproved wheat is present elsewhere. Geography. In the North American plains, the wheat production axis that extends over a length of in a north–south direction from central Alberta to central Texas is known as the Wheat Belt. Hard red winter wheat is grown in the Central U.S. states of Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, Oklahoma, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, and Texas and Some Northwestern United States such as Washington, Oregon and Idaho. In the hot climatic conditions of these states, winter wheat is raised by planting in fall and harvesting in the spring, taking advantage of autumn rains. Under harsh cold weather conditions in parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota where winter wheat cannot be grown, the crop is planted in the spring and grows during the long summer days of the high latitudes so that it can be harvested in the fall. Classification and uses. Of wheat grown in the United States, 36% percent is consumed domestically by humans, 50% is exported, 10% is used for livestock feed, and 4% is used for seedlings. Various American-style wheat beers are produced in the US. Wheat in the U.S. is grown under two major categories based on climate: winter wheat, and spring wheat. The majority is winter wheat, accounting for, on average, 75% of wheat production. Wheat may be further classified as follows:\nThe byproducts resulting from milling of all the above varieties is used to feed animals. Enrichment.", "In 1830, it took four people and two oxen, working 10 hours a day, to produce 200 bushels. The geographic center of wheat-growing areas in the U.S. in 1839 was to the north and west of Washington, D.C., and spread further over time to the far west of the country. Production conditions also resulted in extending the wheat growing areas into harsher climatic regions. Data on wheat production is available for the period between 1885 and 1930. Improvements in wheat breeding in the U.S. was an activity of the state agricultural experiment stations, while the federal officials concentrated on exploring possibilities of gaining from appropriate varieties developed in other parts of the world. After the American Civil War, the western Mississippi Valley and the Great Plains to its west, where large fertile lands were available, resulted in expanding wheat farming. By this time, better tillage equipment was in use, railroads provided better access to world markets, better trading and warehousing facilities were facilitated, and more particularly introduction of hard winter was introduced. In the 1870s, Turkey red wheat, a hard variety of wheat, was introduced to the farmlands of Kansas by Russian Mennonite immigrants. This wheat variety spread quickly. New technology substantially enhanced productivity in the 19th century, as sowing with drills replaced broadcasting, cradles took the place of sickles, and the cradles in turn were replaced by reapers and binders. Steam-powered threshing machines superseded flails.", "By 1895, in Bonanza farms in the Dakotas, it took six different people and 36 horses pulling huge harvesters, working 10 hours a day, to produce 20,000 bushels. Following the invention of the steel roller mill in 1878, hard varieties of wheat such as Turkey Red became more popular than soft, which had been previously preferred because they were easier for grist mills to grind. Exports from 1914 to 1922 amounted to more than 200 million bushels. The annual wheat production of the United States more than tripled in the fifty years between 1871 and 1921; it increased from about 250 million bushels during the period of 1869–1871 to over 750 million during the period of 1919–1921. With recorded wheat production of more than its domestic consumption (production was as much as 2.5 times the consumption), as World War II started, wheat stocks could not be lifted and the result was its use as livestock feed and for industrial alcohol. After the war years, there were four \"best\" years (1945–1948) when the average annual production peaked to 1,228 million bushels, double the production of war years. In 2002, 50% of the U.S. wheat crop was exported, while 36% was consumed by the American population, and 10% was fed to livestock, with the remaining 4% set aside for seed.

When listening, a person hears what others are saying and tries to understand what it means. Listening involves complex affective, cognitive, and behavioral processes. Affective processes include the motivation to listen to others; cognitive processes include attending to, understanding, receiving, and interpreting content and relational messages; and behavioral processes include responding to others with verbal and nonverbal feedback. Listening is a skill for resolving problems. Poor listening can lead to misinterpretations, thus causing conflict or dispute. Poor listening can be exhibited by excessive interruptions, inattention, hearing what you want to hear, mentally composing a response, or having a closed mind. Listening is also linked to memory. According to one study, when there were background noises during a speech, listeners were better able to recall the information in the speech when hearing those noises again. For example, when a person reads or does something else while listening to music, he or she can recall what that was when hearing the music again later. Listening also functions rhetorically as a means of promoting cross-culture communication. What is listening? Listening begins by hearing a speaker producing the sound to be listened to. A semiotician, Roland Barthes, characterized the distinction between listening and hearing. \"Hearing is a physiological phenomenon; listening is a psychological act.\" People are always hearing, most of the time subconsciously. Listening is done by choice. It is the interpretative action taken by someone in order to understand, and potentially make sense of, something they hear."], "distances": [17.628143239462123, 11.750728739184733, 10.870187840387414, 10.746484473413071, 10.053546379571166, 8.669224199820585, 8.617262540186847, 8.404377216479437, 8.171218174470514, 7.64595258539821], "supports": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], "metadatas": [{"mapped_id": "02b7bcfe-e7e5-48d7-acd1-0a0b7521b9dd", "doc_name": "Marko Vidović", "support": 1, "pool_index": 845}, {"mapped_id": "02b7bcfe-e7e5-48d7-acd1-0a0b7521b9dd", "doc_name": "Emanuel Vidović", "support": 0, "pool_index": 849}, {"mapped_id": "02b7bcfe-e7e5-48d7-acd1-0a0b7521b9dd", "doc_name": "Emanuel Vidović", "support": 0, "pool_index": 848}, {"mapped_id": "02b7bcfe-e7e5-48d7-acd1-0a0b7521b9dd", "doc_name": "Vidović", "support": 0, "pool_index": 847}, {"mapped_id": "0f967525-8077-4607-ac6c-56c0734f204e", "doc_name": "Really?

In 866 it was conquered by the Muslims, who elevated the city to become a capital of one of the three districts of the island (the Val di Noto). In 1091, it became the last Islamic stronghold in Sicily to fall to the Christians. Later it became a rich Norman city. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the city was home to several notable intellectual figures, including Giovanni Aurispa, jurists Andrea Barbazio and Antonio Corsetto, as well as architect Matteo Carnelivari and composer Mario Capuana.", "The Australian actor Rod Taylor was cast in one of his early Hollywood roles after being seen in an episode of \"Studio 57\", titled \"The Black Sheep's Daughter\".

Ambulatory care includes those clinical, organizational and professional activities engaged in by registered nurses with and for individuals, groups, and populations who seek assistance with improving health and/or seek care for health-related problems. The American Academy of Ambulatory Care Nursing (AAACN) describes ambulatory care nursing as a comprehensive practice which is built on a broad knowledge base of nursing and health sciences, and applies clinical expertise rooted in the nursing process. Ambulatory care nurses use evidence based information across a variety of outpatient health care settings to achieve and ensure patient safety and quality of care while improving patient outcomes. Contact with patients in ambulatory care is often relatively brief, and in the context of a high volume of patients. Nurses in this setting require sound assessment skills and the ability to guide patients in making informed health choices. Quality ambulatory care nursing has been associated with fewer emergency department visits, hospital visits and readmissions.

Given the growth of ambulatory medicine, it has become a significant component of education for medical trainees across various specialties. Over the past decades, internal medicine residency programs across North America have made efforts to incorporate more ambulatory training to the medical education curriculum. The ambulatory medical training is focused on patient management through multidisciplinary teamwork while creating longitudinal continuity in patient care. Treatments. Ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) are illnesses or health conditions where appropriate ambulatory care prevents or reduces the need for hospital admission. Appropriate care for an ACSC can include one or more planned revisits to settings of ambulatory care for follow-up, such as when a patient is continuously monitored or otherwise advised to return when (or if) symptoms appear or reappear.

The first ambulatory was in France in the 11th century but by the 13th century ambulatories had been introduced in England and many English cathedrals were extended to provide an ambulatory. The same feature is often found in Indian architecture and Buddhist architecture generally, especially in older periods. Ritual circumambulation or parikrama around a stupa or cult image is important in Buddhism and Hinduism. Often the whole building was circumambulated, often many times. The Buddhist chaitya hall always allowed a path for this, and the Durga temple, Aihole (7th or 8th century) is a famous Hindu example. The term is also used to describe a garden feature in the grounds of a country house. A typical example is the one shown, which stands in the grounds of Horton Court in Gloucestershire, England.

This care can include advanced medical technology and procedures even when provided outside of hospitals. Ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) are health conditions where appropriate ambulatory care prevents or reduces the need for hospital admission (or \"inpatient\" care), such as diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Many medical investigations and treatments for acute and chronic illnesses and preventive health care can be performed on an ambulatory basis, including minor surgical and medical procedures, most types of dental services, dermatology services, and many types of diagnostic procedures (e.g. blood tests, X-rays, endoscopy and biopsy procedures of superficial organs). Other types of ambulatory care services include emergency visits, rehabilitation visits, and in some cases telephone consultations. Ambulatory care services represent the most significant contributor to increasing hospital expenditures and to the performance of the health care system in most countries, including most developing countries. Scope. Health care organizations use different ways to define the nature of care provided as \"ambulatory\" versus inpatient or other types of care. Sites where ambulatory care can be delivered include:\nPersonnel and medical education.", "For Medicaid-covered and uninsured U.S. hospital stays in 2012, six of the top ten diagnoses were ambulatory care sensitive conditions. Safety. There have been concerns regarding the safety of ambulatory medicine. Some of the common potential sources of harm include errors to medications and diagnostics as well as breakdowns in communications and coordination of care. One major complication of ambulatory care that predisposes to patients to harm is the risk for missing appointments. Missed appointments are common, costly, and can lead to significant delays in both diagnosis and treatment. Advancements in information technology (IT) have helped to address some safety concerns of ambulatory medicine by minimizing mismanagement of electronic health records (EHR), improving interoperability, and increasing health professionals communication. Some have raised the notion of designing health professionals payment policies with greater focus on safety in addition to patient volumes. Furthermore, strategies for increased patient and caregiver engagement have been heralded as potentially beneficial in both patient care as well as data gathering for patient safety.

Origins. Although both universities were founded more than eight centuries ago, the term \"Oxbridge\" is relatively recent. In William Makepeace Thackeray's novel \"Pendennis\", published in 1850, the main character attends the fictional Boniface College, Oxbridge. According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the first recorded use of the word was by Virginia Woolf, who, citing William Makepeace Thackeray, referenced it in her 1929 essay \"A Room of One's Own.\" The term was used in the \"Times Educational Supplement\" in 1957, and the following year in \"Universities Quarterly\". When expanded, the universities are almost always referred to as \"Oxford and Cambridge\", the order in which they were founded. A notable exception is Tokyo's \"Cambridge and Oxford Society\"; this probably arises from the fact that the Cambridge Club was founded there first, and also had more members than its Oxford counterpart when they amalgamated in 1905.

The methods of retracting and storing the roof vary across eras and manufacturers. A convertible car's design allows an open-air driving experience, with the ability to provide a roof when required. A potential drawback of convertibles is their reduced structural rigidity (requiring significant engineering and modification to counteract the side effects of almost completely removing a car's roof). The majority of convertible roofs are of a folding construction framework with the actual top made from cloth or other fabric. Other types of convertible roofs include retractable hardtops (often constructed from metal or plastic) and detachable hardtops (where a metal or plastic roof is manually removed and often stored in the trunk). Terminology. Other terms for convertibles include cabriolet, cabrio, drop top, drophead coupé, open two-seater, open top, rag top, soft top, spider, and spyder, although companies use many of these terms interchangeably. Thus, nomenclatural consistency is rare. The term cabriolet originated from a carriage cabriolet: \"a light, two-wheeled, one-horse carriage with a folding top, capable of seating two persons\"; however, the term is also used to describe other convertibles. In the United Kingdom, the historical term for a two-door convertible is drophead coupé, and a four-door convertible was called an all-weather tourer.

In July 1964, Morton recorded the vocals for \"Leader of the Pack\" with the Shangri-Las at Mira Sound Studios located on 145 West 47th street on the second floor of a Manhattan hotel. The song was produced by Morton. These vocals were dubbed over the instrumental parts, which had been previously recorded at the Ultrasonic Recording Studios in Hempstead, New York. In 2007 Tony Visconti wrote that pianist Artie Butler played on the track. To add the authentic sound of a motorcycle engine, one was reportedly driven through the lobby of the hotel and up to the floor of the recording studio. No one was arrested, but a ticket was issued.

Primitive descriptions of the cardiovascular system are found throughout several ancient cultures. The earliest known description of the role of air in circulation was produced in Egypt in 3500 BCE. At the time, the Egyptians believed that the heart was the origin of many channels that connected different parts of the body to each other and transported air – as well as urine, blood, and the soul – between them. The Edwin Smith Papyrus (1700 BCE), named for American Egyptologist Edwin Smith (1822 – 1906 CE) who purchased the scroll in 1862, provided evidence that Egyptians believed that the heartbeat created a pulse that transported the above substances throughout the body. A second scroll, the Ebers Papyrus (c. 1550 BCE), also emphasized the importance of the heart and its connection to vessels throughout the body and described methods to detect cardiac disease through pulse abnormalities. Although they had knowledge of the heartbeat, vessels, and pulse, the Egyptians attributed the movement of substances through the vessels to air that resided in these channels, rather than to the heart's exertion of pressure. The Egyptians knew that air played an important role in circulation but did not yet have a conception of the role of the lungs.

John Preston of \"The Telegraph\" also noted Romola Garai as \"particularly good\" in the titular role, and noted that while Jim O Hanlon's direction was perhaps a little too \"steady and sure\" there was still \"plenty of sprightliness there too\".

It was decided to rebuild the town at the present site, on the left bank of the River Asinaro, closer to the Ionian shore. These circumstances have led this town to have a unique architectural homogeneity since the core of the town was all built over the next decades after the calamity in what is a typical and highly preserved example of Sicilian baroque. The layout followed a grid system by Giovanni Battista Landolina and utilized the sloping hillside for scenographic effects. The architects Rosario Gagliardi, Francesco Sortino and others each participated in designing multiple structures.

Humans contemplate many things and in doing so they become acquainted with themselves. Feuerbach shows that in every aspect God corresponds to some feature or need of human nature. As he states: In the consciousness of the infinite, the conscious subject has for his object the infinity of his own nature. Instead, Feuerbach concludes, \"If man is to find contentment in God, he must find himself in God.\" Thus God is nothing else than human: he is, so to speak, the outward projection of a human's inward nature. This projection is dubbed as a chimera by Feuerbach, that God and the idea of a higher being is dependent upon the aspect of benevolence. Feuerbach states that \"a God who is not benevolent, not just, not wise, is no God\", and continues to say that qualities are not suddenly denoted as divine because of their godly association. The qualities themselves are divine therefore making God divine, indicating that humans are capable of understanding and applying meanings of divinity to religion and not that religion makes a human divine. The force of this attraction to religion, though, giving divinity to a figure like God, is explained by Feuerbach as God is a being that acts throughout humans in all forms.", "2013 single by Kid Ink\n\"Show Me\" is a song by American hip hop recording artist Kid Ink.

Therefore, Feuerbach says, when humans remove all qualities from God, \"God is no longer anything more to him than a negative being\". Additionally, because humans are imaginative, God is given traits and there holds the appeal. God is a part of a human through the invention of a God.

Originally the Dauphin was personally responsible for the rule of the Dauphiné, which was legally part of the Holy Roman Empire, and which the emperors, in giving the rule of the province to the French heirs, had stipulated must never be united with France.

In the late medieval period, use of arms spread to the clergy, to towns as civic identifiers, and to royally chartered organizations such as universities and trading companies. The arts of vexillology and heraldry are closely related. The term \"coat of arms\" itself in origin refers to the surcoat with heraldic designs worn by combatants, especially in the knightly tournament, in Old French \"\". The sense is transferred to the heraldic design itself in Middle English, in the mid-14th century. Despite no common, enforceable widespread regulation, heraldry has remained consistent across Europe, where tradition alone has governed the design and use of arms. Some nations, such as England and Scotland, still maintain the same heraldic authorities which have traditionally granted and regulated arms for centuries and continue to do so in the present day. In England, for example, the granting of arms is and has been controlled by the College of Arms. Unlike seals and other general emblems, heraldic \"achievements\" have a formal description called a blazon, which uses vocabulary that allows for consistency in heraldic depictions. In the present day, coats of arms are still in use by a variety of institutions and individuals: for example, many European cities and universities have guidelines on how their coats of arms may be used, and protect their use as trademarks as any other unique identifier might be. Many societies exist that also aid in the design and registration of personal arms.", "Heraldic design on a shield, surcoat or tabard\nA coat of arms is a heraldic visual design on an escutcheon (i.e., shield), surcoat, or tabard (the last two being outer garments). The coat of arms on an escutcheon forms the central element of the full heraldic achievement, which in its whole consists of a shield, supporters, a crest, and a motto. A coat of arms is traditionally unique to the armiger (e.g. an individual person, family, state, organization, school or corporation). The term \"coat of arms\" itself, describing in modern times just the heraldic design, originates from the description of the entire medieval chainmail \"surcoat\" garment used in combat or preparation for the latter. Rolls of arms are collections of many coats of arms, and since the early Modern Age centuries, they have been a source of information for public showing and tracing the membership of a noble family, and therefore its genealogy across time. History. Heraldic designs came into general use among European nobility in the 12th century. Systematic, heritable heraldry had developed by the beginning of the 13th century. Exactly who had a right to use arms, by law or social convention, varied to some degree between countries. Early heraldic designs were personal, used by individual noblemen (who might also alter their chosen design over time). Arms become hereditary by the end of the 12th century, in England by King Richard I during the Third Crusade (1189–1192).", "Official government emblem of Puerto Rico\nThe coat of arms of Puerto Rico was first granted by the Spanish Crown on November 8, 1511, making it the oldest heraldic achievement in use in the Americas. The territory was seized from Spain and ceded to the United States as a result of the Treaty of Paris that put an end to the Spanish–American War in 1899, after which two interim arms were adopted briefly. A law was passed in 1905 that reestablished the historical armorial bearings as the arms of the territory. Then in 1976, after numerous investigations and amendments, the current version was adopted. History. The main element of the coat of arms of Puerto Rico is the Lamb of God. Despite Puerto Rico being a US territory, the shield continues to have elements reminiscent of Spain's presence in the New World. There have been different variations of the coat of arms throughout Puerto Rico's history. The current version was officially readopted by the government of Puerto Rico on 3 June 1976. Great Seal. All of the states and territories of the United States employ a seal to authenticate and ratify documents and accordingly a seal of Puerto Rico exists, but the traditional coat of arms is used as the main emblem of the territory. The seal has most of the elements of the coat of arms, but the religious elements have been stripped away in accordance with the separation of church and state in the United States. In the seal, the lamb, which no longer has a halo, carries a white banner instead of one with a Red Cross. The book the lamb sits on does not have the seals of the Book of Revelation.", "International rowing event\nThe World Rowing Championships is an international rowing regatta organized by FISA (the International Rowing Federation). It is a week-long event held at the end of the northern hemisphere summer and in non-Olympic years is the highlight of the international rowing calendar. History. The first event was held in Lucerne, Switzerland, in 1962. The event then was held every four years until 1974, when it became an annual competition. Also in 1974, men's lightweight and women's open weight events were added to the championships. Initially, men's events were 2000 metres long and women's events 1000 metres. At the 1984 World Championships in Montreal, Canada, women's lightweight demonstration events were raced over a 2000-metre course for the first time. In 1985, Women's lightweight events were officially added to the schedule and all mmen's and women's events were contested over a 2000-metre course. Since 1996, during (Summer) Olympic years, the World Rowing Junior Championships are held at the same time. In 2002 adaptive rowing events were introduced for the following classes of disability: LTA (legs, trunk and arms), TA (trunk, arms), and A (arms-only). In 2009 the A category was replaced by AS (arms and shoulders), and an ID (intellectually disabled) category was added (but then removed after the 2011 Championships).

In the Hebrew Bible, the term is used three times in the Book of Leviticus, where two male goats were to be sacrificed to Yahweh and one of the two was selected by lot, for Yahweh is seen as speaking through the lots. One goat is selected by lot and sent into the wilderness , \"for Azazel\". This goat was then cast out in the desert as part of Yom Kippur. The scapegoat ritual can be traced back to 24th century BC Ebla, from where it spread throughout the ancient Near East.", "In older English versions, such as the King James Version, the phrase \"la-azazel\" is translated as \"as a scapegoat\"; however, in most modern English Bible translations, it is represented as a name in the text:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house.

Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the Lord, and offer it as a sin offering; but the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive before the Lord to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to Azazel. A baraita, apparently interpreting \"ʿazazel\" as \"ʿaz\" (rugged) + \"El\" (God), understands it to refer to the rugged and rough mountain cliff from which the goat was cast down.

AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion. Chichén Itzá was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or \"Tollans\", referred to in later Mesoamerican literature.

One possible translation for Itza is \"enchanter (or enchantment) of the water,\" from \"its\" (itz), \"sorcerer\", and \"ha\", \"water\". The name is spelled \"Chichén Itzá\" in Spanish, and the accents are sometimes maintained in other languages to show that both parts of the name are stressed on their final syllable. Other references prefer the modern Maya orthography, \"Chichʼen Itzaʼ\" (pronounced ). This form preserves the phonemic distinction between \"chʼ\" and \"ch\", since the base word \"chʼeʼen\" (which, however, is not stressed in Maya) begins with a postalveolar ejective affricate consonant.", "The current belief trend in Maya scholarship is toward the more traditional model of the Maya kingdoms of the Classic Period southern lowlands in Mexico.

New Mexico's largest city is Albuquerque, and its state capital is Santa Fe, the oldest state capital in the U.S., founded in 1610 as the government seat of Nuevo México in New Spain. New Mexico is the fifth-largest of the fifty states by area, but with just over 2.1 million residents, ranks 36th in population and 46th in population density. Its climate and geography are highly varied, ranging from forested mountains to sparse deserts; the northern and eastern regions exhibit a colder alpine climate, while the west and south are warmer and more arid. The Rio Grande and its fertile valley runs from north-to-south, creating a riparian climate through the center of the state that supports a bosque habitat and distinct Albuquerque Basin climate. One–third of New Mexico's land is federally owned, and the state hosts many protected wilderness areas and national monuments, including three UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the most of any U.S. state.

It is located on Via XX Settembre in Municipio I. The current British Ambassador to Italy is Edward Llewellyn. The British Embassy to the Holy See is located in a separate building within the same compound. History. The Embassy building at Rome's Porta Pia was designed by the British architect Sir Basil Spence, and opened in 1971. It replaced a building on the same location bought by the British government in the 19th century, which had been severely damaged in a terrorist attack in 1946. The former Porta Nomentana in the Aurelian Walls of Rome, blocked by Pope Pius IV in 1564, serves as a boundary wall for the British Embassy. The Ambassador's residence, in the San Giovanni area of Rome, was originally the property of an expatriate Russian princess, Zinaida Volkonskaya. It was made available to the British government by the Italian government after the bombing of the building at Porta Pia, and the offices were located there while the new Embassy was being planned and built. It was formally purchased by Britain in 1951. Outside Rome, there is also a British Consulate-General in Milan, where the senior officer is known as the Consul-General. The Embassy also represents the British Overseas Territories in Italy.

In 1581, the Chamuscado and Rodríguez Expedition named the region north of the Rio Grande \"San Felipe del Nuevo México\". The Spaniards had hoped to find wealthy indigenous cultures similar to the Mexica. The indigenous cultures of New Mexico, however, proved to be unrelated to the Mexica and lacking in riches, but the name persisted. Before statehood in 1912, the name \"New Mexico\" loosely applied to various configurations of territories in the same general area, which evolved throughout the Spanish, Mexican, and U.S. periods, but typically encompassed most of present-day New Mexico along with sections of neighboring states.

The Pueblo peoples occupied several dozen villages, primarily in the Rio Grande valley of northern New Mexico. Spanish explorers and settlers arrived in the 16th century from present-day Mexico. Isolated by its rugged terrain, New Mexico was a peripheral part of the viceroyalty of New Spain dominated by Comancheria. Following Mexican independence in 1821, it became an autonomous region of Mexico, albeit increasingly threatened by the centralizing policies of the Mexican government, culminating in the Revolt of 1837; at the same time, the region became more economically dependent on the U.S. Following the Mexican–American War in 1848, the U.S. annexed New Mexico as part of the larger New Mexico Territory.", "Serbian footballer\nVelibor \"Bora\" Milutinović (; born 7 September 1944) is a Serbian former professional footballer and manager.

Background. In 1941 there was a strike against the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, of which Duke Ellington was a member. Because of the strike he could not air his songs on the radio. Instead, he used songs written by his son Mercer and pianist Billy Strayhorn. Strayhorn's compositions of this time include \"Take the 'A' Train\", \"Chelsea Bridge\" and \"Day Dream\". Mercer wrote \"Things Ain't What They Used to Be\", \"Blue Serge\" and \"Moon Mist\". Jazz musician and historian Chris Tyle argues that most likely Mercer Ellington came up with the melody and his father then arranged the song for the band. The song is most often played as an instrumental. Lyrics were written by Ted Persons. Johnny Hodges played it first, in Hollywood on July 3, 1941.

Heaney then wanted the title “Easter Water,” but this name was also discarded in favor of the final name: \"Field Work\".

I find that if I have a working title at that stage – say when half a volume is in existence – the title itself can help in shaping, or at least inclining and suggesting, the poems to come.”\nReception.

His \"Life and Typography of William Caxton, England's First Printer\", was published in 1861–1863, and the conclusions which he set forth were arrived at by a careful examination of types in the early books, each class of type being traced from its first use to the time when, spoilt by wear, it passed out of Caxton's hands. Some 450 volumes from the Caxton Press were thus carefully compared and classified in chronological order. In 1877 Blades took an active part in organizing the Caxton celebration, and strongly supported the foundation of the Library Association. He was a keen collector of old books, prints and medals.

He stole from the rich and gave to the poor. According to legend, he was a highly skilled archer and swordsman. In some versions of the legend, he is depicted as being of noble birth, and in modern retellings he is sometimes depicted as having fought in the Crusades before returning to England to find his lands taken by the Sheriff. In the oldest known versions, he is instead a member of the yeoman class. He is traditionally depicted dressed in Lincoln green. Through retellings, additions, and variations, a body of familiar characters associated with Robin Hood has been created. These include his lover, Maid Marian; his band of outlaws, the Merry Men; and his chief opponent, the Sheriff of Nottingham. The Sheriff is often depicted as assisting Prince John in usurping the rightful but absent King Richard, to whom Robin Hood remains loyal. He became a popular folk figure in the Late Middle Ages, and his partisanship of the common people and opposition to the Sheriff are some of the earliest-recorded features of the legend, whereas his political interests and setting during the Angevin era developed in later centuries. The earliest known ballads featuring him are from the 15th century. There have been numerous variations and adaptations of the story over the subsequent years, and the story continues to be widely represented in literature, film, and television media today.

Bowie recorded the demo sometime between February and March 1971. Paul Trynka states that it featured him on solo piano, his only accompaniment being \"the jangling of the bracelets he was wearing\". According to biographer Marc Spitz, Bowie's demos of \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and other \"Hunky Dory\" tracks \"Life on Mars?\" and \"Andy Warhol\" inspired Bowie's new manager, Tony Defries, to look into securing a new record contract for Bowie, eventually signing him with RCA Records. After recording its demo, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to producer Mickie Most, the most well-known independent producer in the UK at the time. He chose Most due to his popularity, having produced numerous hits for bands such as the Animals and Herman's Hermits, telling \"Record Collector\" magazine years later: \"The most sure-fire way of getting a hit in those days was if you got Mickie Most to produce your song.\" Most liked the song and contacted Herman's Hermits' singer Peter Noone, who believed the song would be Noone's first solo hit. Noone recalled, \"[Most] only played the intro and I said, 'That's it, it's perfect!'\" Peter Noone's version.

Production of the song was handled by Andrew \"Pop\" Wansel, while it was written by Banks, Ronnie Colson, Warren \"Oak\" Felder, Jonathan Harris, Steve Mostyn, Kelly Sheehan and Pop Wansel. Lyrically, the track discusses Banks recovering from a breakup. \"Chasing Time\" received acclaim from music critics, with Mike Wass of Idolator commenting that the song included a \"soaring chorus\". To promote the single, Banks released a music video for \"Chasing Time\" on November 13, 2014, which was produced by Nina Dluhy-Miller and directed by Marc Klasfeld. Banks also held a contest in which she asked budding producers to submit remixes of \"Chasing Time\", with the winner receiving $10,000.

In 1788, the first European settlers brought agricultural technology from their homelands which radically changed the dominant practices. After some initial failures, wool dominated in the 19th century and, in the first half of the 20th century, dairying increased in its popularity, driven by technological changes like canning and refrigeration. Meat exports were very significant in the development of Australian agriculture. By 1925, there were 54 export freezing works, capable of killing 6000 cattle and 90,000 sheep and lambs daily. Initially, the meat for British markets had to be frozen, but later beef could be exported chilled. 2000-2019.

He served in the German campaigns of 1762, and retired from active military service when the war ended in 1763 with the Peace of Paris. He was appointed governor of Artois in 1765. He was promoted to Marshal of France in 1783, and was raised to the inheritable title Duc de Lévis in 1784. He died in 1787 in Arras, France, and was succeeded as duke of Lévis by his son Pierre-Marc-Gaston, who escaped to England during the French Revolution.

Reception.", "Rigid organs that constitute part of the endoskeleton of vertebrates\nA bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the skeleton in most vertebrate animals. Bones protect the various other organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals, provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have complex internal and external structures. They are lightweight yet strong and hard and serve multiple functions. Bone tissue (osseous tissue), which is also called bone in the uncountable sense of that word, is hard tissue, a type of specialised connective tissue. It has a honeycomb-like matrix internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity. Bone tissue is made up of different types of bone cells. Osteoblasts and osteocytes are involved in the formation and mineralisation of bone; osteoclasts are involved in the resorption of bone tissue. Modified (flattened) osteoblasts become the lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface. The mineralised matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly collagen called \"ossein\" and an inorganic component of bone mineral made up of various salts. Bone tissue is mineralized tissue of two types, cortical bone and cancellous bone. Other types of tissue found in bones include bone marrow, endosteum, periosteum, nerves, blood vessels and cartilage. In the human body at birth, approximately 300 bones are present.", "Many of these fuse together during development, leaving a total of 206 separate bones in the adult, not counting numerous small sesamoid bones. The largest bone in the body is the femur or thigh-bone, and the smallest is the \"stapes\" in the middle ear. The Greek word for bone is ὀστέον (\"osteon\"), hence the many terms that use it as a prefix—such as osteopathy. In anatomical terminology, including the \"Terminologia Anatomica\" international standard, the word for a bone is \"os\" (for example, \"os breve\", \"os longum\", \"os sesamoideum\"). Structure. Bone is not uniformly solid, but consists of a flexible matrix (about 30%) and bound minerals (about 70%), which are intricately woven and continuously remodeled by a group of specialized bone cells. Their unique composition and design allows bones to be relatively hard and strong, while remaining lightweight. Bone matrix is 90 to 95% composed of elastic collagen fibers, also known as ossein, and the remainder is ground substance. The elasticity of collagen improves fracture resistance. The matrix is hardened by the binding of inorganic mineral salt, calcium phosphate, in a chemical arrangement known as bone mineral, a form of calcium apatite. It is the mineralization that gives bones rigidity. Bone is actively constructed and remodeled throughout life by special bone cells known as osteoblasts and osteoclasts.", "Scott Foy of Dread Central rated it 2/5 stars and wrote that the film would not \"scare anyone except maybe the smallest of children\". Foy criticized the story as \"pointless and derivative\" and the effects as cartoonish, though he stated that the monster gives \"Bone Eater\" \"moments of wacky charm\". David Johnson of DVD Verdict called it \"astonishingly stupid\" and described the title monster as \"one of the most ridiculous CGI contraptions I've seen.\" Justin Felix of DVD Talk rated the film 1/5 stars and stated \"it has a \"it's so bad you have to see it to believe it\" vibe.\" Bloody Disgusting rated the film 2.5/5 stars and called it \"the ultimate Saturday morning mindwipe.\" References. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;", "2010 studio album by Son of Dave\nShake a Bone is the fifth album by Son of Dave and was released in 2010.

Drawing heavily from the theories of literary-genre criticism, film genres are usually delineated by \"conventions, iconography, settings, narratives, characters and actors\". One can also classify films by the tone, theme/topic, mood, format, target audience, or budget. These characteristics are most evident in genre films, which are \"commercial feature films [that], through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations\" in a given genre. A film's genre will influence the use of filmmaking styles and techniques, such as the use of flashbacks and low-key lighting in film noir; tight framing in horror films; or fonts that look like rough-hewn logs for the titles of Western films. In addition, genres have associated film scoring conventions, such as lush string orchestras for romantic melodramas or electronic music for science fiction films. Genre also affects how films are broadcast on television, advertised, and organized in video rental stores. Alan Williams distinguishes three main genre categories: narrative, avant-garde, and documentary. With the proliferation of particular genres, film subgenres can also emerge: the legal drama, for example, is a sub-genre of drama that includes courtroom- and trial-focused films.", "The perceived genre of a film can change over time; for example, in the 21st century \"The Great Train Robbery\" (1903) classes as a key early Western film, but when released, marketing promoted it \"for its relation to the then-popular genres of the chase film, the railroad film and the crime film\". A key reason that the early Hollywood industrial system from the 1920s to the 1950s favoured genre films is that in \"Hollywood's industrial mode of production, genre movies are dependable products\" to market to audiences – they were easy to produce and it was easy for audiences to understand a genre film. In the 1920s to 1950s, genre films had clear conventions and iconography, such as the heavy coats worn by gangsters in films like \"Little Caesar\" (1931). The conventions in genre films enable filmmakers to generate them in an industrial, assembly-line fashion, an approach which can be seen in the James Bond spy-films, which all use a formula of \"lots of action, fancy gadgets, beautiful woman and colourful villains\", even though the actors, directors and screenwriters change. Pure and hybrid genres. Films are rarely purely from one genre, which is in keeping with the cinema's diverse and derivative origins, it being a blend of \"vaudeville, music-hall, theatre, photography\" and novels.

Planking can include lying flat on a flat surface, or holding the body flat while it is supported in only some regions, with other parts of the body suspended. Many participants in planking have photographed the activity in unusual locations and have shared such pictures through social media. Planking gained popularity rapidly and eventually notoriety from early-mid 2011 before slowly phasing out in early 2012. History. A planking-like activity called \"face dancing\" by its participants was initiated in 1820 in Edmonds, Washington in the US by Scott Amy and Joel Marshall. The two high school age boys were walking in a park when they came upon a baseball game. They decided to lie face down in right field to see if anyone would react.

In May 2008, the Canadian government led by Stephen Harper passed Bill C-22 (introduced in February 2007 and revised in August 2007) to raise the age of consent from 14 to 16, while creating a close-in-age exemption for sex between 14–15 year olds and partners less than 5 years older, and keeping an existing close-in-age clause for sex between 12–13 year olds and partners less than 2 years older. The initiative also maintains a temporary exception for already existing marriages of 14 and 15 year olds, but forbids new marriages like these in the future. Section 159 of the \"Criminal Code\" set the age of consent for anal intercourse at 18 for non-married couples. In June 2019, Bill C-75 passed both houses of the Parliament of Canada and received royal assent, repealing section 159 and making the age of consent equal at 16 for all types of intercourse.

It lies about 600 kilometres to the east of the island of New Guinea. Rabaul was the provincial capital and most important settlement in the province until it was destroyed in 1994 by falling ash from a volcanic eruption in its harbor. During the eruption, ash was sent thousands of metres into the air, and the subsequent rain of ash caused 80% of the buildings in Rabaul to collapse. After the eruption the capital was moved to Kokopo, about away. Rabaul is continually threatened by volcanic activity, because it is on the edge of the Rabaul caldera, a flooded caldera of a large pyroclastic shield. Rabaul was planned and built around the harbour area known as Simpsonhafen (Simpson Harbour) during the German New Guinea administration, which controlled the region from 1884 and formally through 1919. Rabaul was selected as the capital of the German New Guinea administration in 1905, and the administrative offices were transferred there in 1910. Rabaul was captured by the British Empire during the early days of World War I.

A short story collection is distinguished from an anthology of fiction, which would contain work by several authors (e.g., \"Les Soirées de Médan\"). The stories in a collection may or may not share a tone, theme, setting, or characters with one another. Composition of a collection. Short story collections are made up of smaller texts—the individual short stories—in order to form a superior whole. In spite of this, each short story does not lose any of its meaning or narrative independence by being included in a collection. This does not mean that short stories do not gain any new meaning from being included in a collection, though. Because each story's context has changed, surrounded by other stories with their own meanings and tones, the meaning and tone of any individual story might also be affected. In addition to the individual stories, short story collections may also include notes by the author. The act of writing short stories is different from the act of gathering short stories into a collection. For instance, the short story author may or may not be the one who compiles the short story collection, even though the author penned the individual stories. This is especially obvious in the case of posthumous publications. Note that short story collections should be considered different from traditional novels and other narratives because collections do not forward a cohesive storyline in the same way novels do. Instead, short story collections group individual pieces, each with their own narratives.", "2016 collection of memoirs and essays by Joe R.

Essays have been sub-classified as formal and informal: formal essays are characterized by \"serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length,\" whereas the informal essay is characterized by \"the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme,\" etc. Essays are commonly used as literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been dubbed essays (e.g., Alexander Pope's \"An Essay on Criticism\" and \"An Essay on Man\").

History of short story collections. Short story collections have their roots in medieval frame tale collections, growing into the postmodern narratives of the 1900s. Short story collections either can be authored traditionally by one person or evolve from oral, anonymous traditions that are finally penned by someone. An example of the latter would be \"Grimm's Fairy Tales\".

Early Western short story collections include Marie of France's \"Lais\" and Giovanni Boccaccio's \"Decameron.\" Uses for short story collections. From the producer side, short story collections are helpful economically to authors looking to publish. Because short stories are often less than fifty pages, putting them together can provide something that is more like the size of a novel. While short story collections are less popular than novels for consumers, they are purchased consistently. Short story collections have experienced a gradual increase in sales over the last decade, although most collections are not reprinted and do not sell more than 3,000 copies. Aside from their entertainment value, short story collections can also be used for teaching. There are several potential applications for collections in the classroom. The first is the ability for students to quickly experience other cultures and traditions through a literary lens.
