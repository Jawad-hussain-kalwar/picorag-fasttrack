According to ITIL, SAM is defined as “…all of the infrastructure and processes necessary for the effective management, control, and protection of the software assets…throughout all stages of their lifecycle.” \nFundamentally intended to be part of an organization's information technology business strategy, the goals of SAM are to reduce information technology (IT) costs and limit business and legal risk related to the ownership and use of software, while maximizing IT responsiveness and end-user productivity. SAM is particularly important for large corporations regarding redistribution of licenses and managing legal risks associated with software ownership and expiration. SAM technologies track license expiration, thus allowing the company to function ethically and within software compliance regulations. This can be important for both eliminating legal costs associated with license agreement violations and as part of a company's reputation management strategy. Both are important forms of risk management and are critical for large corporations' long-term business strategies. SAM is one facet of a broader business discipline known as IT asset management, which includes overseeing both software and hardware that comprise an organization's computers and network. Role within organizations. SAM can serve many different functions within organizations, depending on their software portfolios, IT infrastructures, resource availability, and business goals. For many organizations, the goal of implementing a SAM program is very tactical, explicitly focused on balancing the number of software licenses purchased with the number of actual licenses consumed or used.", "In addition to balancing the number of licenses purchased with the amount of consumption, an effective SAM program must also ensure that the usage of all installed software is in keeping with the terms and conditions of the specific vendor license agreement. In doing so, organizations can minimize liabilities associated with software piracy in the event of an audit by a software vendor or a third party such as the Business Software Alliance (BSA). SAM, according to this interpretation, involves conducting detailed software inventories on an ongoing basis to determine the exact number of software licenses consumed, comparing this information with the number of licenses purchased, and reviewing how the software is being used in respect to the terms and conditions and establishing controls to ensure that proper licensing practices are maintained on an ongoing basis. This can be accomplished through IT processes, purchasing policies and procedures, and technology solutions such as software inventory tools. Counting installations are the most common means of measuring license consumption but some software is licensed by the number of users, capital, processors, or CPU Cores. More broadly defined, the strategic goals of SAM often include (but are not limited to) the following: \nSAM Technology. Several technologies are available to support key SAM processes:\nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO). The ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards are designed to help organizations manage IT assets including software assets (SAM). The published standards are outlined below:\nISO/IEC 19770-1:2017: IT Asset Management Systems Requirements is a process framework to enable an organization to incorporate ITAM (including SAM) processes and policies sufficient to satisfy corporate governance requirements and ensure effective support for IT service management overall.", "The implementation of SAM processes to be \"accomplished in multiple staged increments or tiers.\" Part 1 of the standard details SAM processes including control environment, planning and implementation, inventory, verification and compliance, operations management and life cycle. ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015: Software identification tag; establishes specifications for tagging software to optimize its identification and management. The current version was published in 2015 and is a revision to the 2009 original Software ID Tag standard. Using software identification tags or SWID tags makes discovery a simpler and more accurate process that can be verified by software vendors if they audit an organisations entire estate. SWID tags are implemented and supported by many vendors including IBM, Microsoft and Adobe.

Total return swaps are an example of an off-balance-sheet item. Some companies may have significant amounts of off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities. For example, financial institutions often offer asset management or brokerage services to their clients. The assets managed or brokered as part of these offered services (often securities) usually belong to the individual clients directly or in trust, although the company provides management, depository or other services to the client. The company itself has no direct claim to the assets, so it does not record them on its balance sheet (they are off-balance-sheet assets), while it usually has some basic fiduciary duties with respect to the client. Financial institutions may report off-balance-sheet items in their accounting statements formally, and may also refer to \"assets under management\", a figure that may include on- and off-balance-sheet items. Under previous accounting rules both in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and internationally (IFRS), operating leases were off-balance-sheet financing.

The word is derived from Mithridates VI, the king of Pontus, who so feared being poisoned that he regularly ingested small doses, aiming to develop immunity. Background. Mithridates VI's father, Mithridates V, was assassinated by poisoning by a conspiracy among his attendants. After this, Mithridates VI's mother held regency over Pontus (a Hellenistic kingdom, 281 BC–62 AD) until a male heir came of age. Mithridates was in competition with his brother for the throne and his mother began to favor his brother. Supposedly, during his youth, he began to suspect plots against him at his own mother's orders and was aware of her possible connection with his father's death. He then began to notice pains in his stomach during his meals and suspected his mother had ordered small amounts of poison to be added to his food to slowly kill him off. With other assassination attempts, he fled into the wild. While in the wild, it is said that he began ingesting non-lethal amounts of poisons and mixing many into a universal remedy to make him immune to all known poisons. After Mithridates' death, many Roman physicians claimed to possess and improve the formula. In keeping with most medical practices of his era, Mithridates' anti-poison routines included a religious component, supervised by the \"Agari\", a group of Scythian shamans who never left him.", "Irina or Iryna (Cyrillic: Ирина, Ірина) is a feminine given name of Ancient Greek origin, commonly borne by followers of the Eastern Orthodox Church. It is derived from Eirene (), an ancient Greek goddess, personification of peace. It is mostly used in countries within the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Balkans. Diminutive forms in Slavic languages include Ira, Irinka, Irinushka, Irinochka, Irisha, Irka, Irochka, Irusia, Iraya. Origin. Irina is connected with Irene of Macedonia who was the first woman recognized by the church as a great martyr. She was born pagan as Penelope and later baptized as Irene. Some sources refer to her being baptized by Saint Timothy, in which case she lived in the 1st–2nd century, while others date her death in the year 315. Opinions also differ about the location of her birthplace, the city of Magedon, placing it either in Persia or in Migdonia (Macedonia).

Indian epics talk about this practice as well. It has been said that, during the rule of the king Chandragupta Maurya (320–298 BC), there was a practice of selecting beautiful girls and administering poison in small amounts until they grew up, thus making them insensitive to poison. These maidens were called \"vishakanyas\" (visha 'poison' + kanya 'maiden'). It was believed that making love with vishakanyas could result in the death of their partners, hence they were employed to kill enemies. The emperor Bindusara was the son of the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya and his queen Durdhara. According to the \"Rajavalikatha\", a Jain work, the original name of this emperor was Simhasena. A legend mentioned in the Jain texts tells the story of how Chandragupta's Guru and advisor Chanakya used to feed the emperor with small doses of poison to build his immunity against possible poisoning attempts by his enemies. One day, Chandragupta, unaware that his food contained poison, shared his food with his pregnant wife, Queen Durdhara, who was seven days away from delivery. The queen, who was not immune to the poison, collapsed and died within a few minutes.", "City in Sicily, Italy\nNoto (; ) is a city and in the Province of Syracuse, Sicily, Italy.

According to legend, Daedalus stayed in the city after his flight over the Ionian Sea, as did Hercules after his seventh task. During the Roman era, it opposed the magistrate Verres. In 866 it was conquered by the Muslims, who elevated the city to become a capital of one of the three districts of the island (the Val di Noto). In 1091, it became the last Islamic stronghold in Sicily to fall to the Christians. Later it became a rich Norman city.

Historically, it is attested on cuneiform tablets from Mesopotamia, in ancient Egyptian texts and later Coptic texts, in the Greco-Roman world, in Syriac texts, in the European Middle Ages and early modern period, and among all Jewish groups who co-existed with these groups. The exact definition of what constitutes 'love magic' can be difficult to establish and will vary from scholar to scholar, but a common theme shared by many is the use of magic to start, preserve, or break up a relationship of some type whether for purely sexual or romantic purposes or both. The tools and methods used in its practice do not significantly differ from the way other forms of magic are practiced and include spoken and written spells and incantations, dolls, talismans, amulets, potions, and rituals. As most surviving sources concern love between men and women, there is a strong heterosexual bias when discussing these sources, though there are a few examples known to concern love between both two men and two women, such as Greek curse tablets.

He stole from the rich and gave to the poor. According to legend, he was a highly skilled archer and swordsman. In some versions of the legend, he is depicted as being of noble birth, and in modern retellings he is sometimes depicted as having fought in the Crusades before returning to England to find his lands taken by the Sheriff. In the oldest known versions, he is instead a member of the yeoman class. He is traditionally depicted dressed in Lincoln green. Through retellings, additions, and variations, a body of familiar characters associated with Robin Hood has been created. These include his lover, Maid Marian; his band of outlaws, the Merry Men; and his chief opponent, the Sheriff of Nottingham. The Sheriff is often depicted as assisting Prince John in usurping the rightful but absent King Richard, to whom Robin Hood remains loyal. He became a popular folk figure in the Late Middle Ages, and his partisanship of the common people and opposition to the Sheriff are some of the earliest-recorded features of the legend, whereas his political interests and setting during the Angevin era developed in later centuries. The earliest known ballads featuring him are from the 15th century. There have been numerous variations and adaptations of the story over the subsequent years, and the story continues to be widely represented in literature, film, and television media today. Robin Hood is considered one of the best-known tales of English folklore.", "In popular culture, the term \"Robin Hood\" is often used to describe a heroic outlaw or rebel against tyranny. The origins of the legend as well as the historical context have been debated for centuries. There are numerous references to historical figures with similar names that have been proposed as possible evidence of his existence, some dating back to the late 13th century. At least eight plausible origins to the story have been mooted by historians and folklorists, including suggestions that \"Robin Hood\" was a stock alias used by or in reference to bandits. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBallads and tales. The first clear reference to \"rhymes of Robin Hood\" is from the alliterative poem \"Piers Plowman\", thought to have been composed in the 1370s, followed shortly afterwards by a quotation of a later common proverb, \"many men speak of Robin Hood and never shot his bow\", in \"Friar Daw's Reply\" (c. 1402) and a complaint in \"Dives and Pauper\" (1405–1410) that people would rather listen to \"tales and songs of Robin Hood\" than attend Mass. Robin Hood is also mentioned in a famous Lollard tract dated to the first half of the fifteenth century (thus also possibly predating his other earliest historical mentions) alongside several other folk heroes such as Guy of Warwick, Bevis of Hampton, and Sir Lybeaus.", "The earliest surviving text of a Robin Hood ballad is the 15th-century \"Robin Hood and the Monk\". This is preserved in Cambridge University manuscript Ff.5.48. Written after 1450, it contains many of the elements still associated with the legend, from the Nottingham setting to the bitter enmity between Robin and the local sheriff. The first printed version is \"A Gest of Robyn Hode\" (c. 1500), a collection of separate stories that attempts to unite the episodes into a single continuous narrative. After this comes \"Robin Hood and the Potter\", contained in a manuscript of c. 1503. \"The Potter\" is markedly different in tone from \"The Monk\": whereas the earlier tale is \"a thriller\" the latter is more comic, its plot involving trickery and cunning rather than straightforward force. Other early texts are dramatic pieces, the earliest being the fragmentary \"Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham\" (c. 1475). These are particularly noteworthy as they show Robin's integration into May Day rituals towards the end of the Middle Ages; \"Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham\", among other points of interest, contains the earliest reference to Friar Tuck. The plots of neither \"the Monk\" nor \"the Potter\" are included in the \"Gest\"; and neither is the plot of \"Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne\", which is probably at least as old as those two ballads although preserved in a more recent copy.", "However, the earliest surviving copies of the narrative ballads that tell his story date to the second half of the 15th century, or the first decade of the 16th century. In these early accounts, Robin Hood's partisanship of the lower classes, his devotion to the Virgin Mary and associated special regard for women, his outstanding skill as an archer, his anti-clericalism, and his particular animosity towards the Sheriff of Nottingham are already clear. Little John, Much the Miller's Son, and Will Scarlet (as Will \"Scarlok\" or \"Scathelocke\") all appear, although not yet Maid Marian or Friar Tuck. The friar has been part of the legend since at least the later 15th century, when he is mentioned in a Robin Hood play script. In modern popular culture, Robin Hood is typically seen as a contemporary and supporter of the late-12th-century king Richard the Lionheart, Robin being driven to outlawry during the misrule of Richard's brother John while Richard was away at the Third Crusade. This view first gained currency in the 16th century. It is not supported by the earliest ballads. The early compilation, \"A Gest of Robyn Hode\", names the king as 'Edward'; and while it does show Robin Hood accepting the King's pardon, he later repudiates it and returns to the greenwood. The oldest surviving ballad, \"Robin Hood and the Monk\", gives even less support to the picture of Robin Hood as a partisan of the true king.", "The setting of the early ballads is usually attributed by scholars to either the 13th century or the 14th, although it is recognised they are not necessarily historically consistent. The early ballads are also quite clear on Robin Hood's social status: he is a yeoman. While the precise meaning of this term changed over time, including free retainers of an aristocrat and small landholders, it always referred to commoners. The essence of it in the present context was \"neither a knight nor a peasant or 'husbonde' but something in between\". Artisans (such as millers) were among those regarded as 'yeomen' in the 14th century. From the 16th century on, there were attempts to elevate Robin Hood to the nobility, such as in Richard Grafton's \"Chronicle at Large\"; Anthony Munday presented him at the very end of the century as the Earl of Huntingdon in two extremely influential plays, as he is still commonly presented in modern times. As well as ballads, the legend was also transmitted by 'Robin Hood games' or plays that were an important part of the late medieval and early modern May Day festivities. The first record of a Robin Hood game was in 1426 in Exeter, but the reference does not indicate how old or widespread this custom was at the time. The Robin Hood games are known to have flourished in the later 15th and 16th centuries. It is commonly stated as fact that Maid Marian and a jolly friar (at least partly identifiable with Friar Tuck) entered the legend through the May Games.

Gram panchayats.", "Immature or embryonic shoot\nIn botany, a bud is an undeveloped or embryonic shoot and normally occurs in the axil of a leaf or at the tip of a stem. Once formed, a bud may remain for some time in a dormant condition, or it may form a shoot immediately. Buds may be specialized to develop flowers or short shoots or may have the potential for general shoot development. The term bud is also used in zoology, where it refers to an outgrowth from the body which can develop into a new individual. Overview. The buds of many woody plants, especially in temperate or cold climates, are protected by a covering of modified leaves called \"scales\" which tightly enclose the more delicate parts of the bud. Many bud scales are covered by a gummy substance which serves as added protection. When the bud develops, the scales may enlarge somewhat but usually just drop off, leaving a series of horizontally-elongated scars on the surface of the growing stem. By means of these scars one can determine the age of any young branch, since each year's growth ends in the formation of a bud, the formation of which produces an additional group of bud scale scars. Continued growth of the branch causes these scars to be obliterated after a few years so that the total age of older branches cannot be determined by this means. In many plants, scales do not form over the bud, and the bud is then called a naked bud. The minute underdeveloped leaves in such buds are often excessively hairy.", "The incidence of LASH increases with older age and obesity.

Luxury variants—the Holden Berlina and Holden Calais—and a utility version—the Holden Ute—were available. Succeeding the VZ series, the VE was the first iteration of the fourth generation of the Holden Commodore, a series of automobiles built between 1978 and 2020. Unlike its predecessors, which used Opel-sourced platforms adapted mechanically and in size for the local market, the VE was the first Commodore entirely designed and developed by Holden in Australia. Despite its status as an all-new model, engines—comprising the 3.6-litre V6 and the 6.0-litre V8—derive mainly from the VZ series. To minimise export redevelopment costs, features such as a symmetrical centre console housing a flush-fitting hand brake lever facilitated the conversion to left-hand drive. The VE was internationally badge-engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Omega, Bitter Vero Sport and Pontiac G8. Holden introduced the VE variants in stages, beginning with the sedan in July 2006. Before this, Holden stated they would manufacture two parallel generations of Commodores until the launch of the station wagon and utility. Variants by Holden's performance vehicle partner, Holden Special Vehicles, were released soon after the sedan's debut alongside the long-wheelbase WM Statesman/Caprice models. The VE Ute entered production in 2007, coinciding with the unveiling of the Sportwagon concept car.", "The production version of the Sportwagon—which shared its wheelbase with the sedan instead of the extended wheelbase from the Caprice like previous models—was introduced in July 2008. Holden introduced updates to the VE as model year changes starting in April 2007. Typically subtle, these recurring changes have involved alterations to colours and trim, increased standard equipment, and reduced fuel consumption. More noteworthy adjustments have come in the form of a smaller 3.0-litre V6 engine for entry-level versions and \"Series II\" styling revisions in September 2010. Development. Official manufacture of the VE sedan began at Holden's production facility in Elizabeth, South Australia, on 13 July 2006. Three days later, Holden debuted the car at the Melbourne Convention Centre, broadcast simultaneously via the Internet. Its debut occurred alongside that of the company's flagship model, the Statesman/Caprice (WM). Before this, Holden announced that the VE station wagon and utility variants would be delayed, while the VZ equivalents would continue to be produced. The VE Ute was revealed on 22 August 2007. This was followed by the unveiling of the Sportwagon concept late that year, the production version of which was released in July 2008. Sedan. In 1999 Holden's designers and engineers began laying down the basics of a clean-sheet Commodore sedan. In the seven years of development the car became Holden's largest and most expensive project, representing an expenditure of approximately A$1.03 billion and 3.4 million kilometres (2.1 million miles) of testing.", "In 2004, two years before the release of the VE Commodore, Holden unveiled the Torana TT36 concept car at the Australian International Motor Show in Sydney. This concept previewed the production Commodore and allowed Holden to assess public response to its exterior design. Some production-ready components such as the steering wheel and the handbrake lever were integrated from the TT36 into the production VE. After completing the initial design sketches Holden's engineers quickly began work on developing the chassis. Opel discontinued the rear-wheel drive Omega in 2003. Holden, who used this platform for all earlier Commodore models, had two options: adopt another GM platform or create a new architecture. GM's new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform, which was set to debut in the Cadillac CTS, was offered to Holden's engineers, but they believed that it was unsuitable for the car's requirements. The shoulder width in the rear seat was too narrow. Holden chose to develop a new platform, the GM Zeta, which would also serve as the basis for several upcoming GM vehicles. The car features a double-pivot MacPherson strut front suspension and a four-link independent rear suspension, replacing the earlier MacPherson strut front and semi-trailing arm rear designs. Denny Mooney was appointed chairman of Holden in January 2004. One of Mooney's priorities was to improve the perceived quality issues that surrounded the previous generations of Commodores. Mooney advocated for a reduction of panel gaps by an over previous targets.", "Using three-quarters high-strength steel and an intensive design, the body structure is 50 per cent stiffer than the outgoing model. Strength enhancements include the incorporation of tailor-welded blanks in the front chassis rails and floor reinforcing, resulting in a bare shell mass of . These advancements not only result in noise, vibration and harshness reductions but also lead to improved handling and crash safety. The development of the VE prompted Holden to redesign the facility in Elizabeth, South Australia, facilitating the assembly of entire sections of the car off the foremost production line. This production method allows for a seamless construction of complete sub-sections such as the engine and transmissions to be assembled on rigs that simplify production. This process is applied to the front-end module of the VE Commodore, comprising its headlights, bumpers, airbag sensors and other accessory components. This modular construction permits the easy removal of the entire front-end as a single-piece unit, resulting in reduced repair costs and easier access to the engine bay. This production technique was the first used by GM and won the SAE Australasia's 2006 \"Automotive Engineering Excellence Award\". A modular design structure known as the \"Flex\" strategy has been applied to the interior where fundamentally different components such as audio units and instrument clusters can be swapped out for the various Commodore variants, creating radically varied interior look and feel without much higher costs. The upshot of this is much greater differentiation between the variants than the outgoing model, creating three distinct interior looks, dubbed \"Functional\", \"Performance\" and \"Luxury\".", "Banks initially thought it would receive favorable reception from the labels, but the representatives informed Banks that she had not recorded a \"hit\" single for the album.

Biblical allusions. The original title of the novel was \"The Cheated\". The title of West's work may be a biblical allusion to the Old Testament. Susan Sanderson writes: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The most famous literary or historical reference to locusts is in the Book of Exodus in the Bible, in which God sends a plague of locusts to the pharaoh of Egypt as retribution for refusing to free the enslaved Jews. Millions of locusts swarm over the lush fields of Egypt, destroying its food supplies. Destructive locusts also appear in the New Testament in the symbolic and apocalyptic book of Revelation. West's use of \"locust\" in his title evokes images of destruction and a land stripped bare of anything green and living. The novel is filled with images of destruction: Tod Hackett's painting entitled \"The Burning of Los Angeles,\" his violent fantasies about Faye and the bloody result of the cockfight. A close examination of West's characters and his selective use of natural images, which include representations of violence and impotence — and which are therefore contrary to popular images linking nature and fertility — reveals that the locust in the title is Tod.

The novel follows a young artist from the Yale School of Fine Arts named Tod Hackett, who has been hired by a Hollywood studio to do scene design and painting. While he works he plans an important painting to be called \"The Burning of Los Angeles\", a portrayal of the chaotic and fiery holocaust which will destroy the city. While the cast of characters Tod befriends are a conglomerate of Hollywood stereotypes, his greater discovery is a part of society whose \"eyes filled with hatred\", and \"had come to California to die\". This undercurrent of society captures the despair of Americans who worked and saved their entire lives only to realize, too late, that the American dream was more elusive than they imagine. Their anger boils into rage, and the craze over the latest Hollywood premiere erupts violently into mob rule and absolute chaos. In the introduction to \"The Day of the Locust\", Richard Gehman writes that the novel was \"more ambitious\" than West's previous novel \"Miss Lonelyhearts\", and \"showed marked progress in West's thinking and in his approach toward maturity as a writer.\" Gehman calls the novel \"episodic in structure, but panoramic in form\". Characters. Secondary characters. West's characters are intentionally shallow, stereotyped stock characters, and \"derive from all the B-grade genre films of the period\" (Simon, 523).", "They are what Light calls \"grotesques\". In the first chapter of the novel, the narrative voice announces: \"Yes, despite his appearance, Tod was really a very complicated young man with a whole set of personalities, one inside the other like a nest of Chinese boxes.\" Plot summary. Tod Hackett is the novel's protagonist. He moves from the East coast to Hollywood, California in search of inspiration for his next painting. The novel is set in the 1930s during the Great Depression. Most of the characters exist at the fringes of the Hollywood film industry, but Hollywood is merely the backdrop for Tod Hackett's revelation. Tod is employed by a Hollywood studio \"to learn set and costume designing.\" During his spare time, Tod sketches scenes he observes on large production sets and studio back lots. The novel details Tod's observation of the filming of the Battle of Waterloo. His goal is to find inspiration for the painting he is getting ready to begin, a work titled \"The Burning of Los Angeles.\" Tod falls in love with Faye Greener, an aspiring starlet who lives nearby but Faye only loves men who are good looking or wealthy. She is beautiful but lacks the acting talent to progress beyond roles as an extra. Tod is simply a \"good-hearted man,\" the kind Faye likes. He imagines that loving her would compare to jumping from a skyscraper and screaming to the ground. Tod wants to \"throw himself [at her], no matter what the cost.\" Throughout the novel, Tod fantasizes about having a sexual encounter with Faye as an act of rape.", "Tod vividly revises \"The Burning of Los Angeles\" in his mind, while being pushed around in the human waves of the riot. The final scene plays out, uninterrupted. The conclusion of the novel can be read as a moment of epiphany and mental clarity for the artist, or a complete \"mental breakdown\" and Tod's \"incorporation into the mechanized, modern world of Los Angeles.\" Themes. The characters are outcasts, who have come to Hollywood to fulfill a dream or wish:\n\"The importance of the wish in West's work was first noted by W. H. Auden, who declared (in one of the interludes in \"The Dyer's Hand\") that West's novels were essentially \"parables about a Kingdom of Hell whose ruler is not so much a Father of Lies as a Father of Wishes\". In this respect, James Light, in his book \"Violence, Dreams, and Dostoevsky: The Art of Nathanael West\", suggests that \"The Day of the Locust\" falls in with a motif in West's fiction; the exposure of hopeful narratives in modern American culture as frauds. As some critics point out, West's novel was a radical challenge to modernist literature. Some modernists set themselves up in opposition to mass culture; West depicts it and makes it an integral part of the novel. West's use of grotesque imagery and situations establishes the novel as a work of Juvenalian satire.", "1985 film by Martin Scorsese\nAfter Hours is a 1985 American black comedy film directed by Martin Scorsese, written by Joseph Minion, and produced by Amy Robinson, Griffin Dunne, and Robert F.

Critical response.", "Hearing what others are saying, and trying to understand what it means\nListening is giving attention to a sound. When listening, a person hears what others are saying and tries to understand what it means. Listening involves complex affective, cognitive, and behavioral processes. Affective processes include the motivation to listen to others; cognitive processes include attending to, understanding, receiving, and interpreting content and relational messages; and behavioral processes include responding to others with verbal and nonverbal feedback. Listening is a skill for resolving problems. Poor listening can lead to misinterpretations, thus causing conflict or dispute. Poor listening can be exhibited by excessive interruptions, inattention, hearing what you want to hear, mentally composing a response, or having a closed mind. Listening is also linked to memory. According to one study, when there were background noises during a speech, listeners were better able to recall the information in the speech when hearing those noises again. For example, when a person reads or does something else while listening to music, he or she can recall what that was when hearing the music again later. Listening also functions rhetorically as a means of promoting cross-culture communication. What is listening? Listening begins by hearing a speaker producing the sound to be listened to. A semiotician, Roland Barthes, characterized the distinction between listening and hearing. \"Hearing is a physiological phenomenon; listening is a psychological act.\" People are always hearing, most of the time subconsciously. Listening is done by choice. It is the interpretative action taken by someone in order to understand, and potentially make sense of, something they hear.", "Sophie tosses her phone away and they struggle, inadvertently picking up David's phone in the process, which shows that David accidentally slashed his own throat while trying to use the kukri to open a champagne bottle, which Greg had done earlier, for a TikTok video—revealing there was no real murderer after all.

In 1898, he returned to his home city of Split, bringing new ideas of post-impressionist style light and intense colour. He painted plein air landscapes, and more stylized, larger canvases back in his studio. His early work contained literary allusions to South Slavic history and legends, in an art nouveau style. Later work would become darker, with brighter accents, and expressionist style black outlines around forms. His landscapes, and especially his later interiors of churches around Split and Trogir were well received by critics and the public.

Biography.", "United States automakers manufactured a broad range of convertible models during the 1950s and 1960s – from economical compact-sized models such as the Rambler American and the Studebaker Lark, to the more expensive models, such as the Packard Caribbean, Oldsmobile 98, and Imperial by Chrysler. Automakers often included a convertible body style as an available body style in a model range. Convertibles in the U.S. market peaked in sales around 1965, and fell in popularity over the next five years. Optional air conditioning was gradually becoming more popular, and the availability of sunroofs and T-tops limited the appeal of the open body style. Noise, leaks, and repairs associated with fabric tops also contributed to issues that many customers had. The popularity of convertibles was reduced by the increased travel speeds on roads (resulting in more wind and noise for occupants) and the emergence of more comprehensive vehicle crash safety standards in the United States. The market share of convertibles fell to two or three percent of total sales and the U.S. automakers discontinued the body style from their lineups. American Motors stopped making convertibles after the 1968 model year, Chrysler after 1971, Ford after 1973, and most divisions of General Motors after 1975. Cadillac held out until 1976, when they made about 14,000. The last 200 had a red, white, and blue motif and a dashboard plaque.

Frontier Ruckus’ \"Eternity of Dimming\" is one of those rare gems.\"", "Warner Brothers supplied the production with the newly developed \"All Media Camera,\" which could shoot in any format, including 3-D, using twin lenses placed slightly apart to produce the stereoscopic effect necessary for it. Despite that they were smaller than the twin camera process used previously for 3D, the All-Media Cameras were still bulky and made the film shoot difficult, causing delays when transported to remote desert locations. Further, the director John Farrow and director of photography Robert Burks were unfamiliar with the new technology and had trouble adjusting to using it, while the cameras were frequently broken due to wind blowing sand into the mechanism or from other inclement weather conditions. Farrow used the technology to produce fewer gimmicks than other 3D films did at the time, with only a few scenes showing people or objects coming at the camera, such as gunfire or knives. Instead he preferred to use it to increase the depth of the expansive wide shots of the Mexican desert, or when showing figures against a landscape.

Plot summary. In the Earth of the far distant future, humans have died out and have been replaced, at least in the Americas, by a race descended from bears. Known to themselves as \"Gurrow sapiens\", they live peaceably in communal groupings, trading with each other and sharing communal property, monetary units and duties. Their science has advanced almost to that of pre-atomic age humans. Little is known of other lands on the planet. Raph, a Gurrow archaeologist, learns of the arrival on the continent's eastern seaboard of an unknown race, apparently descended from chimpanzees, who resemble 'Primate Primeval', the extinct race whose existence he has been trying to prove. Their science is more advanced and they are more war-like. It is implied that the arrivals may try to invade and colonise the lands occupied by Gurrows, and that they have developed nuclear weapons. Raph suspects that nuclear war may have been the reason why the original primates became extinct.

He was dissatisfied with the result and it was too short, so he suggested they all drink wine and urinate in the bath at the same time. Upon completion, Wakeman accidentally flicked some marmalade onto the master tape as he was eating. This resulted in Tregurtha spending several hours carefully washing off around 300 feet of tape using soap and water without damaging it. Should the tape have become useless, Wakeman said they would have had to fly the band over and rerecord the parts. In a 2003 interview, Wakeman said he could hear any section of \"No Earthly Connection\" and recall what time of the day he put them to tape. During the recording, Wakeman found himself sitting on a wall crying in a village miles from the studio. \"I still don't know how I got there or why I was crying\" and added, \"It was as if my mind had blown a fuse\".

They feature summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition, with more than 200 teams, representing sovereign states and territories, participating. By default, the Games generally substitute for any world championships during the year in which they take place (however, each class usually maintains its own records). The Olympic Games are held every four years. Since 1994, they have alternated between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years during the four-year Olympiad. Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, held in Olympia, Greece from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, which encompasses all entities and individuals involved in the Olympic Games. The Olympic Charter defines their structure and authority. The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in numerous changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with disabilities, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental Games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games.", "Some sources say as many as 40,000 attended. These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration, horse and chariot racing events. It has been widely written that during the Games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished. This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce. This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars. The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were traveling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus. See also Finley and Pleket. The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend; one of the most popular myths identifies Heracles and his father Zeus as the progenitors of the Games. According to legend, it was Heracles who first called the Games \"Olympic\" and established the custom of holding them every four years. The myth continues that after Heracles completed his twelve labours, he built the Olympic Stadium as an honour to Zeus. Following its completion, he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a \"stadion\" (, Latin: , \"stage\"), which later became a unit of distance. The most widely accepted inception date for the Ancient Olympics is 776 BC; this is based on inscriptions, found at Olympia, listing the winners of a footrace held every four years starting in 776 BC.", "The IOC also endorses the Deaflympics and the Special Olympics. The IOC need to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to the acceptance of professional athletes participating at the Games. The growing importance of mass media has created the issue of corporate sponsorship and general commercialisation of the Games. World Wars I and II led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Olympics; large-scale boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics; and the 2020 Olympics were postponed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 restrictions. The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag, torch, and opening and closing ceremonies. Over 14,000 athletes competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics combined, in 40 different sports and 448 events.

This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and terrorism.

The Games also provide an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.

This \"came after the annual harvest but before the picking of the olives.\" Heralds were sent from Elis to announce the dates. Competition at first was among only \"legitimate sons of free-born Greek parents.\" However, after Macedonia, and then Rome, conquered Greece, the ten Olympic judges loosened the earlier standard and permitted anyone who spoke Greek to participate.

Certain themes were sequestered, so that Heaney might start out again from first principles and deep affiliations.\" Joshua Weiner writes: \"While the move south seemed to some a deliberate withdrawal from a previous political commitment to fight the British presence in Ireland, \"Field Work\" indicates rather a growing commitment to stay engaged, but to do so by maintaining the long view, which asks questions more than it assumes positions.\" In a 1981 interview with Frank Kinahan, Heaney said \"Field Work\" \"was an attempt to try to do something deliberately: to change the note and to lengthen the line, and to bring elements of my social self, elements of my usual nature, which is more convivial than most of the poems before that might suggest, to try to bring all that into play. Title.", "\"Field Work\" is notably less political than \"North\". O’Donoghue writes: “Readers who want Heaney to go on writing political poems, as in \"North\", may be disappointed with \"Field Work\".\" In an interview with Henri Cole in the Fall 1997 volume of \"The Paris Review\", Heaney describes this collection: \"But even if Field Work was less obsessive, more formally rangy, full of public elegies and personal love poems and those Glanmore sonnets, it was still a proof that I could write poetry in my new situation.\" He also calls \"Field Work\" “one of my favorites. In its own way it was a book of change also; it moved me from the intensity of \"North\" to something more measured, in both formal and emotional terms.\" In the same interview, Heaney also said: “I tried very deliberately in \"Field Work\" to turn from a broody, phonetically self-relishing kind of writing to something closer to my own speaking voice. And I think that from \"Field Work\" onwards I have been following that direction. It's a very different kind of linguistic ambition now from what I was after in \"Death of a Naturalist\" or \"Wintering Out\" or \"North\".

Once there, unemployment eventually leads him to join a gang of blackmailers involved in sex crimes, in turn leading to his ruin. Controversy. When the team of Aik Gunahoon Ka Shehr approached the Pakistan Film Censor Board for a clearance certificate, objection was raised over the phrase Gunahoon Ka Shehr.

Secondly, the members of the respected censor board charged that the film contained erotic scenes and dialogue. Consequently, the film appeared before a full board who chopped off several scenes and dialogues which they considered ‘unnecessary’ and ‘irrelevant’, resulting in the producer reshooting them. Annoyed, producer Saeed Iqbal presented his stand before the censor board members, stating that the story of the film depicts the true picture of youth today who indulge in sex and crime. \"The objection was unfair because already a number of Pakistani, Indian and English movies with sexual content are being exhibited at cinemas and cable networks throughout the country,\" he said.

References. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.", "Literary trope\nBuried treasure is a literary trope commonly associated with depictions of pirates, alongside Vikings, criminals, and Old West outlaws. According to popular conception, these people often buried their stolen fortunes in remote places, intending to return to them later (often with the use of a pirate’s treasure map). Pirates burying treasure was a rare occurrence, with the only known instance being William Kidd, who buried some of his wealth on Gardiners Island. The myth of buried pirate treasure was popularized by such 19th-century fiction as \"Wolfert Webber\", \"The Gold-Bug\", and \"Treasure Island\". The idea of treasure maps leading to buried treasure is considered a fictional device. There are cases of buried treasure from different historical periods, such as the Dacian king Decebalus and Visigoth king Alaric I, who both changed the course of rivers to hide their treasures. Legends of buried pirate treasure have existed for centuries, but authenticated discoveries are rare. For example, extensive excavations on Oak Island, Nova Scotia have not yielded any treasure. The only authenticated treasure chest in the United States is kept at the Pirate Soul Museum in St. Augustine, Florida. Buried treasure is a cultural concept and not the same as a hoard, which is typically found by archaeologists and metal detectors. The Fenn treasure, reportedly buried by millionaire Forrest Fenn in 2010, was found in 2020 in Wyoming. Pirates. Pirates burying treasure was rare.", "In 1911, American author Ralph D. Paine conducted a survey of all known or purported stories of buried treasure and published them in \"The Book of Buried Treasure\". He found a common trait in all the stories: there was always a lone survivor of a piratical crew who somehow preserved a chart showing where the treasure was buried, but unable to return himself, he transfers the map or information to a friend or shipmate, usually on his deathbed. This person would then go search in vain for the treasure, but not before transferring the legend down to another hapless seeker. Cases. The Roman historian Dio Cassius says that, in the early 2nd century, the Dacian king Decebalus had changed the course of the river Sargetia and buried tons of gold and silver in the riverbed. Later, he ordered the river to be restored, and the slaves involved in the works to be executed. However, one of his nobles revealed the treasure's location to the Romans. The Byzantine historian Jordanes tells a similar story of the burial of the Visigoth king Alaric I and his treasure under the river Busento in 410. The burial places of the Khazar kings (\"qoruq\") and other inner Asian people were also under a rerouted river. There are a number of reports of supposed buried pirate treasure that surfaced much earlier than these works, indicating that the idea was around for more than a century before those stories were published.", "The only pirate known to have actually buried treasure was William Kidd, who is believed to have buried at least some of his wealth on Gardiners Island near Long Island before sailing into New York City. Kidd had originally been commissioned as a privateer for England, but his behavior had strayed into outright piracy, and he hoped that his treasure could serve as a bargaining chip in negotiations to avoid punishment. His bid was unsuccessful, however, and Kidd was hanged as a pirate. In English fiction, there are three well-known stories that helped to popularize the myth of buried pirate treasure: \"Wolfert Webber\" (1824) by Washington Irving, \"The Gold-Bug\" (1843) by Edgar Allan Poe and \"Treasure Island\" (1883) by Robert Louis Stevenson. These stories differ widely in plot and literary treatment but are all based on the William Kidd legend. David Cordingly states that \"The effect of \"Treasure Island\" on our perception of pirates cannot be overestimated,\" and says the idea of treasure maps leading to buried treasure \"is an entirely fictional device\". Stevenson's \"Treasure Island\" was directly influenced by Irving's \"Wolfert Webber,\" Stevenson saying in his preface, \"It is my debt to Washington Irving that exercises my conscience, and justly so, for I believe plagiarism was rarely carried farther... the whole inner spirit and a good deal of the material detail of my first chapters... were the property of Washington Irving.\"", "Book of several short stories\nA short story collection is a book of short stories and/or novellas by a single author. A short story collection is distinguished from an anthology of fiction, which would contain work by several authors (e.g., \"Les Soirées de Médan\"). The stories in a collection may or may not share a tone, theme, setting, or characters with one another. Composition of a collection. Short story collections are made up of smaller texts—the individual short stories—in order to form a superior whole. In spite of this, each short story does not lose any of its meaning or narrative independence by being included in a collection. This does not mean that short stories do not gain any new meaning from being included in a collection, though. Because each story's context has changed, surrounded by other stories with their own meanings and tones, the meaning and tone of any individual story might also be affected. In addition to the individual stories, short story collections may also include notes by the author. The act of writing short stories is different from the act of gathering short stories into a collection. For instance, the short story author may or may not be the one who compiles the short story collection, even though the author penned the individual stories. This is especially obvious in the case of posthumous publications. Note that short story collections should be considered different from traditional novels and other narratives because collections do not forward a cohesive storyline in the same way novels do.

It was built under the supervision of the master-masons William of Sens and William the Englishman as a shrine for the relics of St. Thomas Becket. The shrine became one of the most popular pilgrimage sites in England. Origin. The chapel was constructed between 1179 and 1184, replacing a much smaller chapel of the same name destroyed by fire, along with much of the rest of the choir, in 1174. Its predecessor was where Becket celebrated his first mass following his installation as Archbishop of Canterbury. Thomas Becket. In 1220, Becket's remains were translated from his first tomb to the finished chapel. As a result of this event, the chapel became a major pilgrimage site, inspiring Geoffrey Chaucer to write \"The Canterbury Tales\" in 1387 and with routes (e.g. from Southwark (Chaucer's route) and the Pilgrim's Way to/from Winchester) converging on the cathedral. Becket's shrine stood until it was destroyed in 1540. This was done on orders from King Henry VIII as vengeance for his ancestor, Henry II. The king also destroyed Becket's bones and ordered that all mention of his name be obliterated. The pavement where the shrine stood in the chapel is today marked by a lighted candle. Modern day archbishops of Canterbury celebrate the Eucharist at this place to commemorate Becket's martyrdom and the translation of his body from his first burial place to this chapel.

In his account of a visit to the cathedral, before the destruction of the shrine, Erasmus said that the saint's head was displayed in the crypt. Records of valuable gifts made there by pilgrims in the 13th century do, however, indicate that there were some relics of St Thomas Becket in the Corona.

Also buried in the chapel are King Henry IV and his second wife, Joan of Navarre, Queen of England. Henry's tomb is on the north side of Trinity Chapel, next to the shrine of St Thomas Becket. It was unusual for a King of England not to be buried at Westminster Abbey, but Becket's cult was then at its height, as evidenced in the \"Canterbury Tales\", and Henry seemed particularly devoted to it, or at least keen to be associated with it. Reasons for his interment in Canterbury are debatable, but it is highly likely that Henry deliberately associated himself with the martyred saint for reasons of political expediency, namely, the legitimation of his dynasty after seizing the throne from his cousin, Richard II. Significantly, at his coronation, he was anointed with holy oil which was said to have been given to Becket by the Virgin Mary shortly before his death in 1170; this oil was placed inside a distinct eagle-shaped container of gold.", "Colorado is an unincorporated community in Bastrop County, Texas, United States.

Naps are most often taken as a response to drowsiness during waking hours. A nap is a form of biphasic or polyphasic sleep, where the latter terms also include longer periods of sleep in addition to one period. For years, scientists have been investigating the benefits of napping, including the 30-minute nap as well as sleep durations of 1–2 hours. Performance across a wide range of cognitive processes has been tested. Benefits. Sara Mednick conducted a study experimenting on the effects of napping, caffeine, and a placebo.

A power nap, also known as a Stage 2 nap, is a short slumber of 20 minutes or less which terminates before the occurrence of deep slow-wave sleep, intended to quickly revitalize the napper.

In these early accounts, Robin Hood's partisanship of the lower classes, his devotion to the Virgin Mary and associated special regard for women, his outstanding skill as an archer, his anti-clericalism, and his particular animosity towards the Sheriff of Nottingham are already clear. Little John, Much the Miller's Son, and Will Scarlet (as Will \"Scarlok\" or \"Scathelocke\") all appear, although not yet Maid Marian or Friar Tuck. The friar has been part of the legend since at least the later 15th century, when he is mentioned in a Robin Hood play script. In modern popular culture, Robin Hood is typically seen as a contemporary and supporter of the late-12th-century king Richard the Lionheart, Robin being driven to outlawry during the misrule of Richard's brother John while Richard was away at the Third Crusade. This view first gained currency in the 16th century. It is not supported by the earliest ballads.

The first printed version is \"A Gest of Robyn Hode\" (c. 1500), a collection of separate stories that attempts to unite the episodes into a single continuous narrative. After this comes \"Robin Hood and the Potter\", contained in a manuscript of c. 1503. \"The Potter\" is markedly different in tone from \"The Monk\": whereas the earlier tale is \"a thriller\" the latter is more comic, its plot involving trickery and cunning rather than straightforward force. Other early texts are dramatic pieces, the earliest being the fragmentary \"Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham\" (c. 1475). These are particularly noteworthy as they show Robin's integration into May Day rituals towards the end of the Middle Ages; \"Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham\", among other points of interest, contains the earliest reference to Friar Tuck.

Preparation for Ranger 3 was complicated by developmental issues with the Agena B stage, which had failed to operate correctly on Rangers 1-2. Agena was primarily the domain of the U.S. Air Force, who intended to use it for military payloads, and NASA had originally assumed it would begin flying in late 1960 or early 1961 by which time any developmental issues with the stage could be weeded out. However, Agena B ended up taking longer to put into service than originally anticipated and its performance also turned out to be somewhat less than expected, which forced some of the planned experiments on the Block II Rangers to be cancelled. While the Thor-Agena B had begun flying in October 1960, the Atlas-Agena B did not make its maiden voyage until July 1961, meaning that Ranger 1 was only the second time this launch vehicle combination been flown. This delay was explained by the fact that Air Force programs such as MIDAS were taking much longer to develop than Ranger.", "In addition, as 1961 ended, Agena Bs had malfunctioned no less than seven times (the two Ranger launches and five Thor-Agena launches).

In addition, an effort would be made to ensure that checkout procedures on U.S. Air Force and NASA Agenas were identical and any differences in them eliminated.

On January 18, 1962, Ranger 3 was stacked atop the booster, but the following day attempted fueling of the Atlas went awry when a tear was found in the intermediate bulkhead separating the LOX and RP-1 tanks. This would mean that the launch vehicle would have to be taken down from the pad for repairs, delaying the launch an entire month. However, Air Force and Convair officials instead suggested the novel solution of doing the repairs right there on LC-12. The Atlas's sustainer engine was removed and lowered into the flame deflector pit and wooden scaffolding installed so that technicians could go up into the RP-1 tank, remove the damaged intermediate bulkhead, and replace it.

This does not mean that short stories do not gain any new meaning from being included in a collection, though. Because each story's context has changed, surrounded by other stories with their own meanings and tones, the meaning and tone of any individual story might also be affected. In addition to the individual stories, short story collections may also include notes by the author. The act of writing short stories is different from the act of gathering short stories into a collection. For instance, the short story author may or may not be the one who compiles the short story collection, even though the author penned the individual stories. This is especially obvious in the case of posthumous publications. Note that short story collections should be considered different from traditional novels and other narratives because collections do not forward a cohesive storyline in the same way novels do. Instead, short story collections group individual pieces, each with their own narratives.", "2016 collection of memoirs and essays by Joe R.

The character first appeared in his 1953 novel \"Casino Royale\"; the books are set in a contemporary period during Fleming's lifetime from 1951 to 1964. Fleming wrote twelve novels and two collections of short stories in the series, all at his Jamaican home Goldeneye and published annually. Two of the books were published after Fleming's death in 1964. Since Fleming's death, other authors have written continuation works. Some of these have been novelisations of episodes in the series of \"James Bond\" films, produced by Eon Productions, while others were either continuation novels or short stories. The first author was Kingsley Amis, writing under the pseudonym of Robert Markham, who produced one novel. He was followed by novelist and biographer John Pearson, who wrote a fictional biography of Bond. Novelist and screenwriter Christopher Wood wrote two novelisations in the late 1970s. John Gardner was asked to continue the series by Ian Fleming Publications, the copyright holders to the franchise; he wrote fourteen novels and two novelisations between 1981 and 1996.

The record entered the UK Singles Chart in July 1968, spending eight weeks on the chart and reaching number 19 as its highest position. The song originated with his signature comedy routine \"heyeah (here) come da judge\", which featured Markham as a courtroom judge dealing with various legal cases and made a mockery of formal courtroom etiquette. Due to its rhythmic use of boastful rhyming dialogue over a funky drum beat, it is considered a precursor to hip hop music. The song contained background vocals from soul singer Minnie Riperton, who was credited as Andrea Davis when she was recording for Chess Records, the label that released \"Here Comes the Judge\".

Bert and Ernie were built by Don Sahlin from a simple design scribbled by Jim Henson, creator of \"The Muppets\". Initially, Henson performed Bert and Oz performed Ernie, but, after just one day of rehearsal, they switched characters. The original idea was to show that even though two people can have totally different characteristics, they can still be good friends. According to writer Jon Stone, the relationship between Bert and Ernie reflected the real-life friendship between Oz and Henson. Although their names are commonly believed to have been drawn from those of two minor characters in the Frank Capra film \"It's A Wonderful Life\", sources from within the \"Sesame Street\" production team suggest that the identical names were coincidental.

In September 2018, Mark Saltzman, one of the script and songwriters for \"Sesame Street\", stated in an interview with \"Queerty\" that when he wrote Bert and Ernie, they were often analogues for his own intimate relationship with film editor Arnold Glassman. Sesame Workshop responded by stating that Bert and Ernie have no sexual orientations, because they are puppets. Frank Oz, who previously performed as Bert, stated Bert and Ernie were not gay, saying,\nThey're not, of course, a gay couple. But why that question? Does it really matter? Why the need to define people as only gay? There's much more to a human being than just straightness or gayness. The Gay Star News reported that fans reacted negatively to Sesame Workshop's statement. Frank Oz later tweeted in September 2018:\nA last thought: If Jim and I had created Bert and Ernie as gay characters they would be inauthentic, coming from two straight men. However, I have now learned that many view them as representative of a loving gay relationship. And that's pretty wonderful. Thanks for helping me understand.

A second puppeteer usually provides the right arm.

An ordinary Bert and Ernie sketch involves Ernie coming up with a hare-brained idea, and Bert trying to talk him out of it, usually getting Bert frustrated and Ernie dumbfounded. For example, if Ernie wanted to do something loud if Bert is doing something quiet like reading a book or the newspaper, Bert would teach him how to be quiet; however, Ernie would still make some noise, which would cause Bert to either lose his temper or leave the room. \"Sesame Street Live\" performer Taylor Morgan said in an interview that \"I just kind of try to think like a six year old or a seven year old, because that's how old Bert is.\" Bert.

It came directly from descendants of the Leichhardt family in Mexico. Disappearance. In 1848 Leichhardt again set out from the Condamine River to reach the Swan River. The expedition consisted of Leichhardt, four Europeans, two Aboriginal guides, seven horses, 20 mules and 50 bullocks. The Europeans were Adolph Classen, Arthur Hentig, Donald Stuart and Thomas Hands, a ticket of leave holder who replaced Kelly at Henry Stuart Russell's Cecil Plains station. The Aboriginal guides were Wommai and Billy Bombat, from Port Stephens. The party was last seen on 3 April 1848 at Allan Macpherson's Cogoon run, an outlying part of Mount Abundance Station, west of Roma on the Darling Downs. Leichhardt's disappearance after moving inland, although investigated by many, remains a mystery. The expedition had been expected to take two to three years, but after no sign or word was received from Leichhardt it was assumed that he and the others in the party had died. The latest evidence suggests that they may have perished somewhere in the Great Sandy Desert of the Australian interior. Four years after Leichhardt's disappearance, the Government of New South Wales sent out a search expedition under Hovenden Hely. The expedition found nothing but a single campsite with a tree marked \"L\" over \"XVA\". In 1858 another search expedition was sent out, this time under Augustus Gregory.", "Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits, suggesting that \"Corythosaurus\" probably fed on all of these. The two species of \"Corythosaurus\" are both present in slightly different levels of the Dinosaur Park Formation. Both still co-existed with theropods and other ornithischians, like \"Daspletosaurus\", \"Brachylophosaurus\", \"Parasaurolophus\", \"Scolosaurus\", and \"Chasmosaurus\". Discovery and species. The first specimen, AMNH 5240, was discovered in 1911 by Barnum Brown in Red Deer River of Alberta and secured by him in the Fall of 1912. As well as an almost complete skeleton, the find was notable because impressions of much of the creature's skin had also survived. The specimen came from the Belly River Group of the province. The left or underside of the skeleton was preserved in carbonaceous clay, making it difficult to expose the skin to the elements. The skeleton was articulated and only missing about the last of the tail and front legs. Both scapulae and coracoids are preserved in position, but the rest of the front legs are gone (except for phalanges and pieces of the humeri, ulnae, and radii). Apparently, the remaining front legs were weathered or eroded away. Impressions of the integument were preserved covering over a large part of the skeleton’s outlining and shows the form of the body. Another specimen, AMNH 5338, was found in 1914 by Brown and Peter Kaisen.", "Thoroughly anti-LDS, Connor viewed the people with disdain, calling them, \"a community of traitors, murderers, fanatics, and whores.\" To dilute their influence he worked with non-LDS business and bank owners, and also encouraged mining. In 1863 some of his troops discovered rich veins of gold and silver in the Wasatch Mountains. In 1866, Thomas Coleman, a Black Mormon man, was murdered, and his body was left on Capitol Hill with an anti-miscegenation warning attached to his body. In 1883, Sam Joe Harvey, another Black man, was lynched for allegedly shooting a police officer, and his body was dragged down State Street. In 1868 Brigham Young founded the Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI) as a way to ward off dependency on outside goods and arguably to hinder ex-LDS retailers.

New Mexico has a significant U.S. military presence, including White Sands Missile Range, and strategically valuable federal research centers, such as the Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories. The state hosted several key facilities of the Manhattan Project, which developed the world's first atomic bomb, and was the site of the first nuclear test, Trinity. In prehistoric times, New Mexico was home to Ancestral Puebloans, the Mogollon culture, and ancestral Ute. Navajos and Apaches arrived in the late 15th century and the Comanches in the early 18th century. The Pueblo peoples occupied several dozen villages, primarily in the Rio Grande valley of northern New Mexico. Spanish explorers and settlers arrived in the 16th century from present-day Mexico. Isolated by its rugged terrain, New Mexico was a peripheral part of the viceroyalty of New Spain dominated by Comancheria. Following Mexican independence in 1821, it became an autonomous region of Mexico, albeit increasingly threatened by the centralizing policies of the Mexican government, culminating in the Revolt of 1837; at the same time, the region became more economically dependent on the U.S. Following the Mexican–American War in 1848, the U.S. annexed New Mexico as part of the larger New Mexico Territory.", "It played a central role in U.S. westward expansion and was admitted to the Union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. New Mexico's history has contributed to its unique demographic and cultural character. It is one of only seven majority-minority states, with the nation's highest percentage of Hispanic and Latino Americans and the second-highest percentage of Native Americans, after Alaska. The state is home to one–third of the Navajo Nation, 19 federally recognized Pueblo communities, and three federally recognized Apache tribes. Its large Hispanic population includes Hispanos descended from settlers during the Spanish era, and later groups of Mexican Americans since the 19th century. The New Mexican flag, which is among the most recognizable in the U.S., reflects the state's eclectic origins, featuring the ancient sun symbol of the Zia, a Puebloan tribe, with the scarlet and gold coloration of the Spanish flag.

New Mexico received its name long before the present-day country of Mexico won independence from Spain and adopted that name in 1821. The name \"Mexico\" derives from Nahuatl and originally referred to the heartland of the Mexica, the rulers of the Aztec Empire, in the Valley of Mexico. Mexican history placed their people's origin in Aztlán, a place to the north from which they migrated to Mexico.", "This account and reports by Spanish explorers of the trade network of the Pueblos and others eventually evolved into the folklore of the Seven Cities of Gold. The 1609 Nahuatl-language \"Crónica Mexicayotl\" made the identification of New Mexico and Aztlán explicit, describing how the Mexica people left \"their home there in Old Mexico Aztlan Quinehuayan Chicomoztoc, which today they call New Mexico ().\" Following their conquest of the Aztecs in the early 16th century, the Spanish began exploring what is now the Southwestern United States calling it \"Nuevo México\". In 1581, the Chamuscado and Rodríguez Expedition named the region north of the Rio Grande \"San Felipe del Nuevo México\". The Spaniards had hoped to find wealthy indigenous cultures similar to the Mexica. The indigenous cultures of New Mexico, however, proved to be unrelated to the Mexica and lacking in riches, but the name persisted. Before statehood in 1912, the name \"New Mexico\" loosely applied to various configurations of territories in the same general area, which evolved throughout the Spanish, Mexican, and U.S. periods, but typically encompassed most of present-day New Mexico along with sections of neighboring states.

The archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico. Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion. Chichén Itzá was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or \"Tollans\", referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site. The ruins of Chichén Itzá are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History).", "Mexican actress and singer (1926–2008)\nMaría Elena Marqués Rangel (14 December 1926 – 11 November 2008) was a Mexican actress and singer who was a star during the Golden Age of Mexican cinema in the 1940s and 1950s.

A potential drawback of convertibles is their reduced structural rigidity (requiring significant engineering and modification to counteract the side effects of almost completely removing a car's roof). The majority of convertible roofs are of a folding construction framework with the actual top made from cloth or other fabric. Other types of convertible roofs include retractable hardtops (often constructed from metal or plastic) and detachable hardtops (where a metal or plastic roof is manually removed and often stored in the trunk). Terminology. Other terms for convertibles include cabriolet, cabrio, drop top, drophead coupé, open two-seater, open top, rag top, soft top, spider, and spyder, although companies use many of these terms interchangeably. Thus, nomenclatural consistency is rare. The term cabriolet originated from a carriage cabriolet: \"a light, two-wheeled, one-horse carriage with a folding top, capable of seating two persons\"; however, the term is also used to describe other convertibles. In the United Kingdom, the historical term for a two-door convertible is drophead coupé, and a four-door convertible was called an all-weather tourer. History.", "Most of the early automobiles were open-air vehicles without any roof or sides. As car engines became more powerful by the end of the 19th century, folding textile or leather roofs (as had been used on victoria or landau carriages) began to appear on cars. Examples of early cars with roofs include the phaeton (a two-seat car with a temporary roof), the brougham or a coupé de ville, having an enclosed passenger compartment at the rear, while the driver sat in front either in the open, or the landaulet, where the driver has a fixed roof and the passenger compartment has a folding roof. Less expensive cars, such as the runabouts, sporting roadsters, or sturdy touring cars, remained either completely open air or were fitted with a rudimentary folding top and detachable clear side curtains. In the 1920s, when steel bodies began to be mass-produced, closed cars became available to the average buyer, and fully open cars began to disappear from the mainstream market. By the mid 1930s, the remaining small number of convertibles sold were high-priced luxury models. In 1939, Plymouth introduced the first mechanically operated convertible roof powered by two vacuum cylinders. Demand for convertibles increased as a result of American soldiers in France and the United Kingdom during World War II familiarizing themselves with small roadster cars, which were not available in the United States at that time. These roadsters included the MG Midget and Triumph Roadster. The convertible design was incorporated into the mass market unibody by Hudson in 1948.", "I am a real perfectionist and it was just really exciting to let go,\" Stansfield said and added on working with Horn: \"He is very clever, he finds out the way you work and what you can do and then makes a space for you to work in.

The production was handled by Trevor Horn, who produced successful songs and albums for numerous artists. Unlike Stansfield's previous albums, \"The Moment\" wasn't completely written by her and Devaney.

Ignoring his father's warnings, Icarus chose to fly too close to the sun, melting the wax, and fell into the sea and drowned. His legs can be seen in the water just below the ship.

Drawing heavily from the theories of literary-genre criticism, film genres are usually delineated by \"conventions, iconography, settings, narratives, characters and actors\". One can also classify films by the tone, theme/topic, mood, format, target audience, or budget. These characteristics are most evident in genre films, which are \"commercial feature films [that], through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations\" in a given genre. A film's genre will influence the use of filmmaking styles and techniques, such as the use of flashbacks and low-key lighting in film noir; tight framing in horror films; or fonts that look like rough-hewn logs for the titles of Western films. In addition, genres have associated film scoring conventions, such as lush string orchestras for romantic melodramas or electronic music for science fiction films. Genre also affects how films are broadcast on television, advertised, and organized in video rental stores.

The band spent late March and April 1978 writing and rehearsing material. During the Stiff/Chiswick Challenge concert at Manchester's Rafters club on 14 April, they caught the attention of TV music presenter Tony Wilson and manager Rob Gretton. Curtis berated Wilson for not putting the group on his Granada Television show \"So It Goes\"; Wilson responded that Joy Division would be the next band he would showcase on TV. Gretton, the venue's resident DJ, was so impressed by the band's performance that he convinced them to take him on as their manager. Gretton, whose \"dogged determination\" was later credited for much of the band's public success, contributed the business skills to provide Joy Division with a better foundation for creativity.

The packaging of \"An Ideal for Living\"—which featured a drawing of a Hitler Youth member on the cover—coupled with the nature of the band's name fuelled speculation about their political affiliations. While Hook and Sumner later said they were intrigued by fascism at the time, Morris believed that the group's dalliance with Nazi imagery came from a desire to keep memories of the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents during World War II alive. He argued that accusations of neo-Nazi sympathies merely provoked the band \"to keep on doing it, because that's the kind of people we are\".

The group consisted of vocalist, guitarist and lyricist Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. Sumner and Hook formed the band after attending a June 1976 Sex Pistols concert. While Joy Division's first recordings were heavily influenced by early punk rock, they soon developed a sparse sound and style that made them one of the pioneering groups of the post-punk genre and movement. Their self-released 1978 debut EP \"An Ideal for Living\" drew the attention of the Manchester television personality Tony Wilson, who signed them to his independent label Factory Records. Their debut album \"Unknown Pleasures\", recorded with producer Martin Hannett, was released in 1979. Curtis struggled with personal problems, including a failing marriage, depression, and epilepsy. As the band's popularity grew, Curtis's health condition made it increasingly difficult for him to perform; he occasionally experienced seizures on stage. He died by suicide on the eve of what would have been the band's first North American tour in May 1980, aged 23. Joy Division's second and final album, \"Closer\", was released two months later; it and the single \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" became their highest-charting releases.

Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band the Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join the Panik, and even had Curtis audition. On 18 July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions. Driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off. In August 1977, Warsaw placed an advertisement in a music shop window seeking a replacement drummer. Stephen Morris, who had attended the same school as Curtis, was the sole respondent. Deborah Curtis, Ian's wife, stated that Morris \"fitted perfectly\" with the band, and that with his addition Warsaw became a \"complete 'family'\".

Major reforms put forward by the British in the 1930s also recognized the principle of federalism, which was carried forward into the governance of independent India.

Ghiyas ud din Balban (1200–1287) was a Turkic ruler of the Delhi Sultanate during the rule of Mamluk dynasty of Delhi (or Slave dynasty) from 1266 to 1287. He was one of the most prominent rulers of the Slave Dynasty. The tomb of Balban was discovered in the mid-20th century. Overview. It is an imposing stone and masonry building, though lacking the splendid ornamentation to be seen in the tomb of his master, Iltutmish. The tomb is surrounded by the ruins of an extensive late-medieval settlement and it offers, from certain angles, a remarkable view of the Qutub Minar. To the east of Balban's tomb, lies a ruined rectangular structure said to be the grave of Khan Shahid, Balban's son, whose original name was Muhammad, who died fighting against the Mongols near Multan in 1285.

The stories in a collection may or may not share a tone, theme, setting, or characters with one another. Composition of a collection. Short story collections are made up of smaller texts—the individual short stories—in order to form a superior whole. In spite of this, each short story does not lose any of its meaning or narrative independence by being included in a collection. This does not mean that short stories do not gain any new meaning from being included in a collection, though. Because each story's context has changed, surrounded by other stories with their own meanings and tones, the meaning and tone of any individual story might also be affected. In addition to the individual stories, short story collections may also include notes by the author. The act of writing short stories is different from the act of gathering short stories into a collection. For instance, the short story author may or may not be the one who compiles the short story collection, even though the author penned the individual stories. This is especially obvious in the case of posthumous publications. Note that short story collections should be considered different from traditional novels and other narratives because collections do not forward a cohesive storyline in the same way novels do.

The protagonist of the series, James Bond, is a British Secret Service agent, often referred to by his code name 007. The character first appeared in his 1953 novel \"Casino Royale\"; the books are set in a contemporary period during Fleming's lifetime from 1951 to 1964. Fleming wrote twelve novels and two collections of short stories in the series, all at his Jamaican home Goldeneye and published annually. Two of the books were published after Fleming's death in 1964. Since Fleming's death, other authors have written continuation works. Some of these have been novelisations of episodes in the series of \"James Bond\" films, produced by Eon Productions, while others were either continuation novels or short stories. The first author was Kingsley Amis, writing under the pseudonym of Robert Markham, who produced one novel. He was followed by novelist and biographer John Pearson, who wrote a fictional biography of Bond. Novelist and screenwriter Christopher Wood wrote two novelisations in the late 1970s. John Gardner was asked to continue the series by Ian Fleming Publications, the copyright holders to the franchise; he wrote fourteen novels and two novelisations between 1981 and 1996. After Gardner retired due to ill health, author Raymond Benson continued the stories and wrote six \"Bond\" novels, three novelisations and three short stories between 1996 and 2002.", "They will be able to communicate by satellite phone.

Essays have been sub-classified as formal and informal: formal essays are characterized by \"serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length,\" whereas the informal essay is characterized by \"the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme,\" etc. Essays are commonly used as literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been dubbed essays (e.g., Alexander Pope's \"An Essay on Criticism\" and \"An Essay on Man\"). While brevity usually defines an essay, voluminous works like John Locke's \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" and Thomas Malthus's \"An Essay on the Principle of Population\" are counterexamples. In some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays have become a major part of formal education. Secondary students are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills; admission essays are often used by universities in selecting applicants, and in the humanities and social sciences essays are often used as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams.", "\"A Positive\" is a 1998 horror short story by Kaaron Warren.

It is owned by Gray Television alongside dual NBC/Telemundo affiliate KHNL (channel 13) and Kailua-Kona–licensed KFVE (channel 6), which relays KHNL's second and sixth digital subchannels. The stations share studios on Waiakamilo Road in Honolulu's Kapālama neighborhood; KGMB's transmitter is located in Akupu, Hawaii. History. The station first signed on the air on December 1, 1952, as the second television station in Hawaii. KGMB-TV was originally owned by J. Howard Worrall along with KGMB radio (AM 590, now KSSK) and operated from studios on Kapiolani Boulevard in Honolulu. The station carried programming from three of the four major networks at the time (excluding DuMont), but was a primary CBS affiliate owing to KGMB-AM's long affiliation with CBS Radio. The station lost NBC programming when KONA-TV (channel 2, now KHON-TV) signed on two weeks later, and lost ABC when KULA-TV (channel 4, now KITV) launched in April 1954. In 1973, a partnership led by future Hawaii congressman Cecil Heftel bought KGMB-AM-TV, then turned around and sold the KGMB stations to Lee Enterprises in 1977. Lee sold off the radio station in 1980.", "In 1982, the station dropped the \"-TV\" suffix from its call sign. The real-life KGMB news crew was often featured in one of the longest-running police dramas on CBS in the 1970s, \"Hawaii Five-O\". The station also had ties to the iconic series' reboot, as CBS allowed KGMB to let its viewers preview the season premiere episode early at the Waikiki Shell each September during the rebooted series' run. In 2000, Lee exited from television broadcasting and sold most of its television holdings (including KGMB) to Emmis Communications. Emmis already owned KHON-TV, so it had to obtain a cross-ownership waiver for the purchase of KGMB from the Federal Communications Commission, to bypass the recently passed duopoly rules that forbid common ownership of two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market. This waiver was renewed several times while Emmis owned both stations. At that time, KHON moved its operations into KGMB's facility, though the two stations maintained separate news departments. From September 2, 2002, to October 31, 2004, KGMB carried select UPN programming via a secondary affiliation shared with KHON; each station aired programs from that network that the other station did not air. The two stations began carrying UPN programming in September 2002 after KFVE (which had been with UPN since its January 1995 launch) disaffiliated from the network to become a full-time affiliate of The WB (whose programming aired on KFVE in a secondary capacity since December 1998).", "Later, with an emphasis on weather, the station branded itself \"Hawaii's Severe Weather Station\". Channel swap. On August 18, 2009, MCG Capital and Raycom Media (owner of KHNL and, at the time, KFVE) announced a shared services agreement with Raycom as senior partner. As part of the deal, KGMB vacated its longtime studios on Kapiolani Boulevard; the combined operation would be based at KHNL/KFVE's studios on Waiakamilo Road. Though non-news programming would remain in place, news operations of the three stations would be combined into a single entity. The arrangement would also see a channel swap, with KGMB moving from virtual channel 9 (UHF digital channel 23) to channel 5 (UHF digital channel 22) and KFVE move from 5 to 9. The resulting ownership arrangement of the stations generated some controversy, as it had the effect of Raycom trading KFVE to MCG Capital in return for KGMB. Organizations such as media watchdog group Media Council Hawaii viewed the plan as a way to circumvent FCC rules preventing one company owning two of the four highest-rated stations in the same market—in this case, KGMB and KHNL. However, the FCC only recognizes ownership of facility identifications, which remain attached to their channel numbers, and not ownership of a station's intellectual unit (call letters, programming, network affiliation, etc.).", "In addition, the station also shared ABC programming with CBS affiliate KSL-TV (channel 5, now an NBC affiliate) until KUTV (channel 2) signed on in September 1954 as a full-time ABC affiliate. KTVX is the oldest television station located in the Mountain Time Zone and the third oldest station located west of the Mississippi River. It was also the first independently owned television station to sign-on in the United States. The station changed its call letters to KTVT in 1954 (the KTVT call letters are now used on the CBS owned-and-operated station in Dallas–Fort Worth). Its call letters later changed to KCPX-TV in 1959 following its sale to Screen Gems Broadcasting (a division of Screen Gems, then the television division of Columbia Pictures). Some notable local programs during channel 4's early years included the children's programs \"Hotel Balderdash\" (which debuted on September 11, 1972) and \"Fireman Frank\", and horror film showcase \"Nightmare Theater\", the latter two programs were both hosted by Ron Ross. At this time, the station was using an \"Open 4\" logo that was later implemented by WAPA-TV in San Juan, Puerto Rico (that station used several variations of the logo from the 1970s until implementing a new logo in 1987). The station swapped affiliations with KUTV in 1960 and became an ABC affiliate. KTVX by then had become the first television station in Utah to broadcast in color and was one of the first ABC affiliates to broadcast in color.", "KIKU, an independent station specializing in Japanese programming, became a secondary UPN affiliate on November 1, 2004, and remained with the network until its closure on September 15, 2006. Emmis itself prepared to exit the television industry and sold KHON to the Montecito Broadcast Group in 2006. Emmis then announced on February 20, 2007, that KGMB and its satellites had been sold to MCG Capital Corporation for $40 million, resulting in one of the rare instances involving a complete separation of a television station duopoly. The FCC approved the sale in late May and was completed on June 4, 2007. Shortly after MCG Capital Corporation took over, KGMB adopted a logo similar to the one it used in the early 1980s and also rolled out a new graphics package for its newscast and a new website. For many years, KGMB billed itself as \"One of the Good Things About Hawaii\" with its rich history of local television programming exclusively in Hawaii, especially in such shows as \"Skipper Al\" and \"Checkers &amp; Pogo\" (both children's programs; the latter being the most remembered, airing from 1967 to 1982 and featured Morgan White), \"The Hawaii Moving Company\" (originally a disco/dance program that transitioned into a general interest show), and the 1982 television special \"Rap's Hawaii\" starring Rap Reiplinger.

Mel wrote several sets of cyclic madrigals, i.e. sets of madrigals which set successive stanzas of a long poem (Monteverdi's \"Sestina: Lagrime d'Amante al Sepolcro dell'Amata\" is probably the most famous example of a cyclic madrigal set).", "Franco-Flemish composer\nRinaldo del Mel (also René del Mel, del Melle) (probably 1554 – c. 1598) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance, mainly active in Italy, and a member of the Roman School of composition. He likely studied with Palestrina, and was a skilled and prolific composer, especially of cyclic madrigals of the type popular in Rome. Life. Mel was born in Mechelen to an aristocratic family closely connected to the Duchy of Lorraine; his father was in charge of the financial management of the Duke's estate. In 1562, at the probable age of eight, he began study at the Cathedral of St. Rombaut, with Séverin Cornet being his principal teacher. In 1572, after finishing his schooling, he was sent to Lisbon by his family, where he may have served as \"maestro di cappella\" at the court (according to Giuseppe Baini, the 19th century writer on music, who was not always a reliable source). By 1580 he was in Rome, possibly studying with Palestrina. Records indicate he was at Chieti in 1583, and in January 1584 in Venice; in July of that year he accepted a position as \"maestro di cappella\" at Rieti Cathedral, but was dismissed shortly thereafter for being too often absent from his duties. Between 1585 and 1591 Mel traveled widely, returning to Flanders, including Liège and Antwerp. He served briefly as \"maestro di cappella\" for the Duke of Bavaria, then in Liège, for at least a few months beginning in July 1587.", "Italian politician (1916–1991)\nRinaldo \"Dino\" Del Bo (19 November 1916 – 16 January 1991) was an Italian politician who served in the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community, serving as President of the body between 9 October 1963 and 1967 as the Del Bo Authority.

Its name is associated with the mythical condition of lycanthropy, a supernatural affliction in which humans are said to physically shapeshift into wolves. The term is used by researchers mostly in the broader sense of transformation into animals in general, that, strictly speaking, is described as zoanthropy. Signs and symptoms. Affected individuals believe that they are in the process of transforming into an animal, or have already transformed into an animal. Clinical Lycanthropy has been associated with the altered states of mind that accompany psychosis, the mental state that typically involves delusions and hallucinations, with the transformation only seeming to happen in the mind and behavior of the affected person. A 1988 study on clinical lycanthropy from the McLean Hospital reported on a series of cases, and proposed some diagnostic criteria by which clinical lycanthropy could be recognised:\nAccording to these criteria, either a delusional belief in current or past transformation or behavior that suggests a person thinks of themselves as transformed is considered evidence of clinical lycanthropy. The authors note that, although the condition seems to be an expression of psychosis, there is no specific diagnosis of mental or neurological illness associated with its behavioral consequences. Clinical lycanthropy is not specific to an experience of human-to-wolf transformation.", "However, there are suggestions that certain neurological conditions and cultural influences may result in the expression of the human-animal transformation theme that defines the condition. Neurological factors. One important factor may be differences or changes in parts of the brain known to be involved in representing body shape (e.g., see proprioception and body image). A neuroimaging study of two people diagnosed with clinical lycanthropy showed that these areas display unusual activation, suggesting that when people report their bodies are changing shape, they may be genuinely perceiving those feelings. Treatment. Because clinical lycanthropy is strongly associated with psychotic disorders, antipsychotic medication is often an effective treatment. It may also be treated with antidepressants or mood stabilizers, in cases in which it is a symptom of depression or bipolar disorder. Patients with clinical lycanthropy may also benefit from a cultural approach to treatment, as the syndrome is generally agreed to be culture-bound. Related disorders. Clinical lycanthropy is a type of delusional misidentification syndrome of the self, and it often overlaps with other delusional misidentification syndromes. For example, there is a case study of a psychiatric patient who had both clinical lycanthropy and Cotard delusion. In rare cases, individuals may believe that other people have transformed into animals. This has been termed \"lycanthropic intermetamorphosis\" and \"lycanthropy spectrum.\"", "A wide variety of creatures have been reported as part of the shape-shifting experience. A 2004 review of the medical literature lists over thirty published cases of clinical lycanthropy, only the minority of which have wolf (Lycanthropy) or dog (Cynanthropy) themes. Canines are certainly not uncommon, although the experience of being transformed into other animals such as a hyena, cat, horse, bird, or tiger has been reported on more than one occasion. Transformation into frogs, and even bees, has been reported in some instances. The term \"ophidianthropy\" refers to the delusion that one has been transformed into a snake, of which two case studies have been reported. In Japan, transformation into foxes and dogs was common (, ). A 1989 case study described how one individual reported a serial transformation, experiencing a change from human to dog, to a horse, and then to a cat, before returning to the reality of human existence after treatment. There are also reports of people who experienced transformation into an animal only listed as \"unspecified.\" Proposed mechanisms. Clinical lycanthropy is a very rare condition and is largely considered to be an idiosyncratic expression of a psychotic or dissociative episode caused by another condition such as Dissociative Identity Disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or clinical depression. It has also been associated with drug intoxication and withdrawal, cerebrovascular disease, traumatic brain injury, dementia, delirium, and seizures.", "Listening differs from obeying. A person who receives and understands information or an instruction, and then chooses not to comply with it or not to agree to it, has listened to the speaker, even though the result is not what the speaker wanted. How does one listen? Listening may be considered as a simple and isolated process, but it would be more precise to perceive it as a complex and systematic process. It involves the perception of sounds made by the speaker, of intonation patterns that focus on the information, and of the relevance of the topic under discussion. People listen for 45 percent of their time when they communicate. According to Barthes, listening can be understood on three levels: alerting, deciphering, and understanding how the sound is produced and how it affects the listener. All three levels of listening , and sometimes all at once. The second and third levels overlap and intertwine, in that obtaining, understanding, and deriving meaning are part of the same process. In this way anyone, on hearing a doorknob turn (obtaining), can almost automatically assume that someone is at the door (deriving meaning). Active listening. \"Active listening\" involves listening to what is being said and attempting to understand it. It can be described in many ways. Active listening requires that the listener be attentive, nonjudgmental, and non-interrupting. An active listener analyzes what the speaker is saying for its implicature or subtext as well as for meanings contained explicitly in the verbal communication.", "Hearing what others are saying, and trying to understand what it means\nListening is giving attention to a sound. When listening, a person hears what others are saying and tries to understand what it means. Listening involves complex affective, cognitive, and behavioral processes. Affective processes include the motivation to listen to others; cognitive processes include attending to, understanding, receiving, and interpreting content and relational messages; and behavioral processes include responding to others with verbal and nonverbal feedback. Listening is a skill for resolving problems. Poor listening can lead to misinterpretations, thus causing conflict or dispute. Poor listening can be exhibited by excessive interruptions, inattention, hearing what you want to hear, mentally composing a response, or having a closed mind. Listening is also linked to memory. According to one study, when there were background noises during a speech, listeners were better able to recall the information in the speech when hearing those noises again. For example, when a person reads or does something else while listening to music, he or she can recall what that was when hearing the music again later. Listening also functions rhetorically as a means of promoting cross-culture communication. What is listening? Listening begins by hearing a speaker producing the sound to be listened to. A semiotician, Roland Barthes, characterized the distinction between listening and hearing. \"Hearing is a physiological phenomenon; listening is a psychological act.\" People are always hearing, most of the time subconsciously. Listening is done by choice. It is the interpretative action taken by someone in order to understand, and potentially make sense of, something they hear."], "distances": [85.77431988568843, 47.18793194970236, 42.22129966059984, 38.90739494481018, 37.58009418567026], "supports": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0], "metadatas": [{"mapped_id": "028633ba-c1b3-4705-8045-1b419bea970e", "doc_name": "Clinical lycanthropy", "support": 1, "pool_index": 1285}, {"mapped_id": "028633ba-c1b3-4705-8045-1b419bea970e", "doc_name": "Clinical lycanthropy", "support": 1, "pool_index": 1287}, {"mapped_id": "028633ba-c1b3-4705-8045-1b419bea970e", "doc_name": "Clinical lycanthropy", "support": 1, "pool_index": 1286}, {"mapped_id": "0aec3852-dba6-4c26-b942-b202de21b6a4", "doc_name": "Listening", "support": 0, "pool_index": 513}, {"mapped_id": "0aec3852-dba6-4c26-b942-b202de21b6a4", "doc_name": "Listening", "support": 0, "pool_index": 512}], "recall": 1.0, "precision": 0.6, "ndcg": 1.0, "mrr": 1.0}

The type and quantity vary between regions. The US is ranked fourth in production volume of wheat, with almost 50 million tons produced in 2020, behind only China, India and Russia. The US is ranked first in crop export volume; almost 50% of its total wheat production is exported. The United States Department of Agriculture defines eight official classes of wheat: durum wheat, hard red spring wheat, hard red winter wheat, soft red winter wheat, hard white wheat, soft white wheat, unclassed wheat, and mixed wheat. Winter wheat accounts for 70 to 80 percent of total production in the US, with the largest amounts produced in Kansas (10.8 million tons) and North Dakota (9.8 million tons). The US hard red spring wheat crop is exported to over 70 countries each year to the extent of 55%. Of the total wheat produced in the country, 50% is exported, valued at US$9 billion. History. According to Ricardo Alegria, wheat was first cultivated in New Spain by afro-spanish conquistador Juan Garrido in the 16th century. Although it was first introduced to the Western Hemisphere following the discovery of the New World, wheat came to be grown in North American soil only during the colonial period. During the colonial period, wheat was sown by broadcasting, reaped by sickles, and threshed by flails. The kernels were then taken to a grist mill for grinding into flour.", "It is not known whether the unapproved wheat is present elsewhere. Geography. In the North American plains, the wheat production axis that extends over a length of in a north–south direction from central Alberta to central Texas is known as the Wheat Belt. Hard red winter wheat is grown in the Central U.S. states of Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, Oklahoma, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, and Texas and Some Northwestern United States such as Washington, Oregon and Idaho. In the hot climatic conditions of these states, winter wheat is raised by planting in fall and harvesting in the spring, taking advantage of autumn rains. Under harsh cold weather conditions in parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota where winter wheat cannot be grown, the crop is planted in the spring and grows during the long summer days of the high latitudes so that it can be harvested in the fall. Classification and uses. Of wheat grown in the United States, 36% percent is consumed domestically by humans, 50% is exported, 10% is used for livestock feed, and 4% is used for seedlings. Various American-style wheat beers are produced in the US. Wheat in the U.S. is grown under two major categories based on climate: winter wheat, and spring wheat. The majority is winter wheat, accounting for, on average, 75% of wheat production. Wheat may be further classified as follows:\nThe byproducts resulting from milling of all the above varieties is used to feed animals. Enrichment.", "In 1830, it took four people and two oxen, working 10 hours a day, to produce 200 bushels. The geographic center of wheat-growing areas in the U.S. in 1839 was to the north and west of Washington, D.C., and spread further over time to the far west of the country. Production conditions also resulted in extending the wheat growing areas into harsher climatic regions. Data on wheat production is available for the period between 1885 and 1930. Improvements in wheat breeding in the U.S. was an activity of the state agricultural experiment stations, while the federal officials concentrated on exploring possibilities of gaining from appropriate varieties developed in other parts of the world. After the American Civil War, the western Mississippi Valley and the Great Plains to its west, where large fertile lands were available, resulted in expanding wheat farming. By this time, better tillage equipment was in use, railroads provided better access to world markets, better trading and warehousing facilities were facilitated, and more particularly introduction of hard winter was introduced. In the 1870s, Turkey red wheat, a hard variety of wheat, was introduced to the farmlands of Kansas by Russian Mennonite immigrants. This wheat variety spread quickly. New technology substantially enhanced productivity in the 19th century, as sowing with drills replaced broadcasting, cradles took the place of sickles, and the cradles in turn were replaced by reapers and binders. Steam-powered threshing machines superseded flails.", "By 1895, in Bonanza farms in the Dakotas, it took six different people and 36 horses pulling huge harvesters, working 10 hours a day, to produce 20,000 bushels. Following the invention of the steel roller mill in 1878, hard varieties of wheat such as Turkey Red became more popular than soft, which had been previously preferred because they were easier for grist mills to grind. Exports from 1914 to 1922 amounted to more than 200 million bushels. The annual wheat production of the United States more than tripled in the fifty years between 1871 and 1921; it increased from about 250 million bushels during the period of 1869–1871 to over 750 million during the period of 1919–1921. With recorded wheat production of more than its domestic consumption (production was as much as 2.5 times the consumption), as World War II started, wheat stocks could not be lifted and the result was its use as livestock feed and for industrial alcohol. After the war years, there were four \"best\" years (1945–1948) when the average annual production peaked to 1,228 million bushels, double the production of war years. In 2002, 50% of the U.S. wheat crop was exported, while 36% was consumed by the American population, and 10% was fed to livestock, with the remaining 4% set aside for seed. Wheat harvesting occurs on land area of 60–63 million acres. Genetically modified wheat, which \"is not approved for cultivation anywhere in the world\", was found in an Oregon farm in June 2013. The grain was modified by Monsanto to tolerate weed killer treatments.", "Bockbier or Doppelbock (double Bockbier) can have an alcohol content of up to 16%, making it stronger than many wines.

He transferred to the painting department, but was dissatisfied with the conservatism of the teaching, and in 1890 gave up his formal studies. He struggled for a time to support himself, painting scenes around Venice. In 1892 he arrived in Milan, where he worked at Famiglia Artistica. In 1894, one of Vidović's paintings was exhibited in Milan along with works by Giovanni Segantini. That same year, he spent time in Chioggia, a quiet fishing town with picturesque lagoons and canals. Among the paintings of the time was a canvas bathed in light, painted in broad strokes, and some romantic dawn and dusk landscapes, which reflect the spirit of symbolism. On his return to Split, Vidović developed a close relationship with painters Josip Lalić, Ante Katunarić and Virgil Meneghello Dinčić, and with the builder Ante Bezić.

From 1900 he was an active member of the Literary-Art Club, and in 1907, together with Ivan Meštrović, he founded the Medulić Society. Though he had trained at the Academy of Arts in Venice, he never completed his formal studies, preferring instead to paint scenes of Venice – interiors, views of canals, lagoons and motifs from around the town of Chioggia. In 1898, he returned to his home city of Split, bringing new ideas of post-impressionist style light and intense colour. He painted plein air landscapes, and more stylized, larger canvases back in his studio. His early work contained literary allusions to South Slavic history and legends, in an art nouveau style. Later work would become darker, with brighter accents, and expressionist style black outlines around forms. His landscapes, and especially his later interiors of churches around Split and Trogir were well received by critics and the public. Vidović was elected a corresponding member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1949. He exhibited his work at solo and group shows within Croatia and abroad.

Ambulatory care includes those clinical, organizational and professional activities engaged in by registered nurses with and for individuals, groups, and populations who seek assistance with improving health and/or seek care for health-related problems. The American Academy of Ambulatory Care Nursing (AAACN) describes ambulatory care nursing as a comprehensive practice which is built on a broad knowledge base of nursing and health sciences, and applies clinical expertise rooted in the nursing process. Ambulatory care nurses use evidence based information across a variety of outpatient health care settings to achieve and ensure patient safety and quality of care while improving patient outcomes. Contact with patients in ambulatory care is often relatively brief, and in the context of a high volume of patients. Nurses in this setting require sound assessment skills and the ability to guide patients in making informed health choices. Quality ambulatory care nursing has been associated with fewer emergency department visits, hospital visits and readmissions.

This care can include advanced medical technology and procedures even when provided outside of hospitals. Ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) are health conditions where appropriate ambulatory care prevents or reduces the need for hospital admission (or \"inpatient\" care), such as diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Many medical investigations and treatments for acute and chronic illnesses and preventive health care can be performed on an ambulatory basis, including minor surgical and medical procedures, most types of dental services, dermatology services, and many types of diagnostic procedures (e.g. blood tests, X-rays, endoscopy and biopsy procedures of superficial organs). Other types of ambulatory care services include emergency visits, rehabilitation visits, and in some cases telephone consultations. Ambulatory care services represent the most significant contributor to increasing hospital expenditures and to the performance of the health care system in most countries, including most developing countries. Scope. Health care organizations use different ways to define the nature of care provided as \"ambulatory\" versus inpatient or other types of care. Sites where ambulatory care can be delivered include:\nPersonnel and medical education.", "For Medicaid-covered and uninsured U.S. hospital stays in 2012, six of the top ten diagnoses were ambulatory care sensitive conditions. Safety. There have been concerns regarding the safety of ambulatory medicine. Some of the common potential sources of harm include errors to medications and diagnostics as well as breakdowns in communications and coordination of care. One major complication of ambulatory care that predisposes to patients to harm is the risk for missing appointments. Missed appointments are common, costly, and can lead to significant delays in both diagnosis and treatment. Advancements in information technology (IT) have helped to address some safety concerns of ambulatory medicine by minimizing mismanagement of electronic health records (EHR), improving interoperability, and increasing health professionals communication. Some have raised the notion of designing health professionals payment policies with greater focus on safety in addition to patient volumes. Furthermore, strategies for increased patient and caregiver engagement have been heralded as potentially beneficial in both patient care as well as data gathering for patient safety.

She said that she identified with the feelings that might lead someone to use heroin: \"I've been in that place where you've messed up and you're so lost that you don't know who you are anymore, and you're miserable—and here's this escape route. I've never done heroin, but I've done plenty of other things to escape.\" She said that the song is about \"trying not to take responsibility for other people's problems and trying to love yourself at the same time\".

Originally the Dauphin was personally responsible for the rule of the Dauphiné, which was legally part of the Holy Roman Empire, and which the emperors, in giving the rule of the province to the French heirs, had stipulated must never be united with France. Because of this, the Dauphiné suffered from anarchy in the 14th and 15th centuries, since the Dauphins were frequently minors or concerned with other matters.

For example, he married Charlotte of Savoy against his father's wishes. Savoy was a traditional ally of the Dauphiné, and Louis wished to reaffirm that alliance to stamp out rebels and robbers in the province.

During the late Second Temple period (after the closure of the Hebrew Bible canon), Azazel came to be viewed as a fallen angel responsible for introducing humans to forbidden knowledge, as described in the Book of Enoch. His role as a fallen angel partly remains in Christian and Islamic traditions. Bible. Torah. In the Hebrew Bible, the term is used three times in the Book of Leviticus, where two male goats were to be sacrificed to Yahweh and one of the two was selected by lot, for Yahweh is seen as speaking through the lots. One goat is selected by lot and sent into the wilderness , \"for Azazel\". This goat was then cast out in the desert as part of Yom Kippur. The scapegoat ritual can be traced back to 24th century BC Ebla, from where it spread throughout the ancient Near East.", "In older English versions, such as the King James Version, the phrase \"la-azazel\" is translated as \"as a scapegoat\"; however, in most modern English Bible translations, it is represented as a name in the text:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house. He shall take the two goats and set them before the Lord at the entrance of the tent of meeting; and Aaron shall cast lots on the two goats, one lot for the Lord and the other lot for Azazel. Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the Lord, and offer it as a sin offering; but the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive before the Lord to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to Azazel. A baraita, apparently interpreting \"ʿazazel\" as \"ʿaz\" (rugged) + \"El\" (God), understands it to refer to the rugged and rough mountain cliff from which the goat was cast down. Wilhelm Gesenius translated the name as something akin to \"the averter\", which he supposed to have first referred to an idol, before being lent to a demon in the Enochian texts. However, neither this demon nor the root are attested. In the Septuagint and later translations.", "During 2014 and 2015, Jacobs directed the two seasons of the SKY/HBO show, \"Doll &amp; Em\".

Evidence in the Chilam Balam books indicates another, earlier name for this city prior to the arrival of the Itza hegemony in northern Yucatán.

This earlier name is difficult to define because of the absence of a single standard of orthography, but it is represented variously as \"Uuc Yabnal\" (\"Seven Great House\"), \"Uuc Hab Nal\" (\"Seven Bushy Places\"), \"Uucyabnal\" (\"Seven Great Rulers\") or \"Uc Abnal\" (\"Seven Lines of Abnal\"). This name, dating to the Late Classic Period, is recorded both in the book of Chilam Balam de Chumayel and in hieroglyphic texts in the ruins. Location.

The archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico. Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion. Chichén Itzá was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or \"Tollans\", referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.

One possible translation for Itza is \"enchanter (or enchantment) of the water,\" from \"its\" (itz), \"sorcerer\", and \"ha\", \"water\". The name is spelled \"Chichén Itzá\" in Spanish, and the accents are sometimes maintained in other languages to show that both parts of the name are stressed on their final syllable. Other references prefer the modern Maya orthography, \"Chichʼen Itzaʼ\" (pronounced ). This form preserves the phonemic distinction between \"chʼ\" and \"ch\", since the base word \"chʼeʼen\" (which, however, is not stressed in Maya) begins with a postalveolar ejective affricate consonant.", "The current belief trend in Maya scholarship is toward the more traditional model of the Maya kingdoms of the Classic Period southern lowlands in Mexico. Economy. Chichén Itzá was a major economic power in the northern Maya lowlands during its apogee. Participating in the water-borne circum-peninsular trade route through its port site of Isla Cerritos on the north coast, Chichen Itza was able to obtain locally unavailable resources from distant areas such as obsidian from central Mexico and gold from southern Central America. Between AD 900 and 1050 Chichén Itzá expanded to become a powerful regional capital controlling north and central Yucatán. It established Isla Cerritos as a trading port. History. The layout of Chichén Itzá site core developed during its earlier phase of occupation, between 750 and 900 AD. Its final layout was developed after 900 AD, and the 10th century saw the rise of the city as a regional capital controlling the area from central Yucatán to the north coast, with its power extending down the east and west coasts of the peninsula. The earliest hieroglyphic date discovered at Chichen Itza is equivalent to 832 AD, while the last known date was recorded in the Osario temple in 998. Establishment. The Late Classic city was centered upon the area to the southwest of the Xtoloc cenote, with the main architecture represented by the substructures now underlying the Las Monjas and Observatorio and the basal platform upon which they were built.

Some 450 volumes from the Caxton Press were thus carefully compared and classified in chronological order. In 1877 Blades took an active part in organizing the Caxton celebration, and strongly supported the foundation of the Library Association. He was a keen collector of old books, prints and medals.

Reception.", "Rigid organs that constitute part of the endoskeleton of vertebrates\nA bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the skeleton in most vertebrate animals. Bones protect the various other organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals, provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have complex internal and external structures. They are lightweight yet strong and hard and serve multiple functions. Bone tissue (osseous tissue), which is also called bone in the uncountable sense of that word, is hard tissue, a type of specialised connective tissue. It has a honeycomb-like matrix internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity. Bone tissue is made up of different types of bone cells. Osteoblasts and osteocytes are involved in the formation and mineralisation of bone; osteoclasts are involved in the resorption of bone tissue. Modified (flattened) osteoblasts become the lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface. The mineralised matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly collagen called \"ossein\" and an inorganic component of bone mineral made up of various salts. Bone tissue is mineralized tissue of two types, cortical bone and cancellous bone. Other types of tissue found in bones include bone marrow, endosteum, periosteum, nerves, blood vessels and cartilage. In the human body at birth, approximately 300 bones are present.", "Many of these fuse together during development, leaving a total of 206 separate bones in the adult, not counting numerous small sesamoid bones. The largest bone in the body is the femur or thigh-bone, and the smallest is the \"stapes\" in the middle ear. The Greek word for bone is ὀστέον (\"osteon\"), hence the many terms that use it as a prefix—such as osteopathy. In anatomical terminology, including the \"Terminologia Anatomica\" international standard, the word for a bone is \"os\" (for example, \"os breve\", \"os longum\", \"os sesamoideum\"). Structure. Bone is not uniformly solid, but consists of a flexible matrix (about 30%) and bound minerals (about 70%), which are intricately woven and continuously remodeled by a group of specialized bone cells. Their unique composition and design allows bones to be relatively hard and strong, while remaining lightweight. Bone matrix is 90 to 95% composed of elastic collagen fibers, also known as ossein, and the remainder is ground substance. The elasticity of collagen improves fracture resistance. The matrix is hardened by the binding of inorganic mineral salt, calcium phosphate, in a chemical arrangement known as bone mineral, a form of calcium apatite. It is the mineralization that gives bones rigidity. Bone is actively constructed and remodeled throughout life by special bone cells known as osteoblasts and osteoclasts.", "Scott Foy of Dread Central rated it 2/5 stars and wrote that the film would not \"scare anyone except maybe the smallest of children\". Foy criticized the story as \"pointless and derivative\" and the effects as cartoonish, though he stated that the monster gives \"Bone Eater\" \"moments of wacky charm\".

Short story collections are made up of smaller texts—the individual short stories—in order to form a superior whole. In spite of this, each short story does not lose any of its meaning or narrative independence by being included in a collection. This does not mean that short stories do not gain any new meaning from being included in a collection, though. Because each story's context has changed, surrounded by other stories with their own meanings and tones, the meaning and tone of any individual story might also be affected.

For instance, the short story author may or may not be the one who compiles the short story collection, even though the author penned the individual stories.
