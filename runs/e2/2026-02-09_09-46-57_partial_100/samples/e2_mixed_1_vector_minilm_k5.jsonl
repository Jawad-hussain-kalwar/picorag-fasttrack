It was first released in Sweden in February 1997 as the fourth single from her debut studio album, \"Robyn Is Here\" (1995). The song was her third UK and second US single. Robyn wrote it with Max Martin, who also produced the song with Denniz Pop. It is sometimes confused with Robin S.'s 1993 single \"Show Me Love\" because of identical song titles and similar first names; however, the two songs are not related.\nCritical reception. Larry Flick from \"Billboard\" described the song as a \"far more seductive tone of this jeep-pop confection\" than her earlier hit single, \"Do You Know (What It Takes)\". He noted that Robyn \"proves her capability to handle a meaty tune with a respectable degree of soul. She tweaks the song's ear-grabbing chorus and muscular bassline with subtle improvisations and an assertive edge that impresses.\" In a retrospective review, Can't Stop the Pop felt that on the song \"she's dropping her guard and committing herself to a teen-pop romance. They added that the chorus is \"spectacularly catchy.\" British magazine \"Music Week\" gave \"Show Me Love\" five out of five, naming it the \"strongest track\" from the album, \"[that] should launch her as a serious contender for the swingbeat crown.\"\nChart performance.", "em_loose": 1.0, "generation_ms": 7436, "mode": "mixed", "cited_indices": [], "gold_indices": [1, 2, 3, 4], "citation_precision": 0.0, "citation_recall": 0.0}
