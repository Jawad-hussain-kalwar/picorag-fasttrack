A 12th ship, the French frigate \"Le Grifon\", had sailed with the fleet. Its captain was unfamiliar with the Florida coastline and elected to stay further out to sea. The \"Grifon\" safely returned to Europe. Because the fleet was carrying silver, it is also known as the 1715 Plate Fleet (\"plata\" being the Spanish word for silver). Some artifacts and even coins still wash up on Florida beaches from time to time. According to Cuban records, around 1,500 sailors perished while a small number survived in lifeboats.

After a family friend gave the Jacksons a Super 8 cine-camera with Peter in mind, he began making short films with his friends. Jackson has long cited \"King Kong\" as his favourite film, and around the age of nine he attempted to remake it using his own stop-motion models. Also, as a child Jackson made a World War II epic called \"The Dwarf Patrol\" seen on the \"Bad Taste\" bonus disc, which featured his first special effect of poking pinholes in the film for gun shots, and a James Bond spoof named \"Coldfinger\".", "Biographer Dan Wooding believe the album is Wakeman's \"own personal journey into the unknown\". Recording. Wakeman recalled the difficulty in getting A&amp;M to understand and support \"No Earthly Connection\" partly due to the length of \"Music Reincarnate\" which occupied the entire first side and finish on part of the second. The label suggested to have parts cut in order for the track to fit on a single side, but Wakeman refused as its length was what he intended the piece to be. He also refused to extend the piece to fill both sides entirely as it resembled the problem he had with the Yes album \"Tales from Topographic Oceans\" (1973), a double album containing four, side long tracks that were deliberately extended to fit each side of a vinyl, an idea that Wakeman disagreed with. Instead, Wakeman filled the second side with two \"related story wise\" tracks, \"The Prisoner\" and \"The Lost Cycle\". The album was recorded from January to March 1976 with Wakeman credited as the producer. He was joined by engineer Paul Tregurtha and engineering assistant Didier Utard. Wakeman lived in the studio building with the engineers for the entire time, with his band members staying for a large amount of it.

According to ITIL, SAM is defined as “…all of the infrastructure and processes necessary for the effective management, control, and protection of the software assets…throughout all stages of their lifecycle.” \nFundamentally intended to be part of an organization's information technology business strategy, the goals of SAM are to reduce information technology (IT) costs and limit business and legal risk related to the ownership and use of software, while maximizing IT responsiveness and end-user productivity. SAM is particularly important for large corporations regarding redistribution of licenses and managing legal risks associated with software ownership and expiration. SAM technologies track license expiration, thus allowing the company to function ethically and within software compliance regulations. This can be important for both eliminating legal costs associated with license agreement violations and as part of a company's reputation management strategy. Both are important forms of risk management and are critical for large corporations' long-term business strategies. SAM is one facet of a broader business discipline known as IT asset management, which includes overseeing both software and hardware that comprise an organization's computers and network. Role within organizations. SAM can serve many different functions within organizations, depending on their software portfolios, IT infrastructures, resource availability, and business goals. For many organizations, the goal of implementing a SAM program is very tactical, explicitly focused on balancing the number of software licenses purchased with the number of actual licenses consumed or used.", "In addition to balancing the number of licenses purchased with the amount of consumption, an effective SAM program must also ensure that the usage of all installed software is in keeping with the terms and conditions of the specific vendor license agreement. In doing so, organizations can minimize liabilities associated with software piracy in the event of an audit by a software vendor or a third party such as the Business Software Alliance (BSA). SAM, according to this interpretation, involves conducting detailed software inventories on an ongoing basis to determine the exact number of software licenses consumed, comparing this information with the number of licenses purchased, and reviewing how the software is being used in respect to the terms and conditions and establishing controls to ensure that proper licensing practices are maintained on an ongoing basis. This can be accomplished through IT processes, purchasing policies and procedures, and technology solutions such as software inventory tools. Counting installations are the most common means of measuring license consumption but some software is licensed by the number of users, capital, processors, or CPU Cores. More broadly defined, the strategic goals of SAM often include (but are not limited to) the following: \nSAM Technology. Several technologies are available to support key SAM processes:\nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO). The ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards are designed to help organizations manage IT assets including software assets (SAM). The published standards are outlined below:\nISO/IEC 19770-1:2017: IT Asset Management Systems Requirements is a process framework to enable an organization to incorporate ITAM (including SAM) processes and policies sufficient to satisfy corporate governance requirements and ensure effective support for IT service management overall.", "The implementation of SAM processes to be \"accomplished in multiple staged increments or tiers.\" Part 1 of the standard details SAM processes including control environment, planning and implementation, inventory, verification and compliance, operations management and life cycle. ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015: Software identification tag; establishes specifications for tagging software to optimize its identification and management. The current version was published in 2015 and is a revision to the 2009 original Software ID Tag standard. Using software identification tags or SWID tags makes discovery a simpler and more accurate process that can be verified by software vendors if they audit an organisations entire estate. SWID tags are implemented and supported by many vendors including IBM, Microsoft and Adobe. ISO/IEC 19770-3:2016: Entitlement Management Schema outlines a technical schema which can be used to encapsulate license details including contract information, entitlements, rights, limitations and details about invoice, PO numbers, etc. ISO/IEC 19770-4:2017: Resource Utilization Measurement provides an ITAM data standard for Resource Utilization Measurement (\"RUM\"). ISO/IEC 19770-5:2015: Overview and Vocabulary provides an overview of the 19770 standards as well as defines vocabulary used throughout the standards. Issues with scalability. An example of issues faced when scaling up discovery tools is with Microsoft's System Centre Configuration Manager (SCCM).", "Using SCCM Metering Rules to monitor software usage across a small estate or a small number of applications is relatively easy and reliable given the total number of unique executables (.exe files) and the number of instances of each executable. Turning on Metering Rules for every packaged application and every executable in a large estate quickly makes the volume of data generated unmanageable and expensive to maintain. Most SAM tools which consume SCCM data rely on these Metering Rules to understand usage.

{"query_id": "0066d36e-f0e8-4cbb-a302-4c4d0b0498f2", "documents": ["Self-dosing with poison to gain immunity\nMithridatism is the practice of protecting oneself against a poison by gradually self-administering non-lethal amounts. The word is derived from Mithridates VI, the king of Pontus, who so feared being poisoned that he regularly ingested small doses, aiming to develop immunity. Background. Mithridates VI's father, Mithridates V, was assassinated by poisoning by a conspiracy among his attendants. After this, Mithridates VI's mother held regency over Pontus (a Hellenistic kingdom, 281 BC–62 AD) until a male heir came of age. Mithridates was in competition with his brother for the throne and his mother began to favor his brother. Supposedly, during his youth, he began to suspect plots against him at his own mother's orders and was aware of her possible connection with his father's death. He then began to notice pains in his stomach during his meals and suspected his mother had ordered small amounts of poison to be added to his food to slowly kill him off. With other assassination attempts, he fled into the wild. While in the wild, it is said that he began ingesting non-lethal amounts of poisons and mixing many into a universal remedy to make him immune to all known poisons. After Mithridates' death, many Roman physicians claimed to possess and improve the formula. In keeping with most medical practices of his era, Mithridates' anti-poison routines included a religious component, supervised by the \"Agari\", a group of Scythian shamans who never left him.", "Chanakya entered the room at the moment she collapsed, and in order to save the child in the womb, he immediately cut open the dead queen's belly and took the baby out. He was just in time; a drop of poison had already reached the baby and touched his head, leaving a permanent blueish spot (a \"bindu\") on his forehead. Thus, the newborn was named \"Bindusara\". In practice. Mithridatism is not effective against all types of poison. Immunity is generally only possible with biologically complex types which the immune system can respond to. Depending on the toxin, the practice can lead to the lethal accumulation of a poison in the body. Results depend on how each poison is processed by the body, i.e. on how the toxic compound is metabolized or passed out of the body. However, in some cases, it is possible to build up a metabolic tolerance against specific non-biological poisons. This involves conditioning the liver to produce more of the particular enzymes that metabolize these poisons. For example, heavy drinkers develop a tolerance to the effects of alcohol. However, metabolic tolerance can also lead to accumulation of the less toxic metabolized compound which can slowly damage the liver. With alcohol this generally leads to conditions such as alcoholic fatty liver disease. Metabolic tolerance is not effective on all types of non-biological poisons. Exposure to certain toxic substances, such as hydrofluoric acid and heavy metals, is either lethal or has little to no effect. A minor exception is cyanide, which can be metabolized by the liver.", "The enzyme rhodanese converts the cyanide into the much less toxic thiocyanate. This process allows humans to ingest small amounts of cyanide in food like apple seeds and survive small amounts of cyanide gas from fires and cigarettes. However, one cannot effectively condition the liver against cyanide, unlike alcohol. Relatively larger amounts of cyanide are still highly lethal because, while the body can produce more rhodanese, the process also requires large amounts of sulfur-containing substrates. In literature. Mithridatism has been used as a plot device in fiction and on-screen; including the Indian fantasy series \"Chandrakanta\", Alexandre Dumas's \"The Count of Monte Cristo\", Holly Black's \"The Cruel Prince\", Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"Rappaccini's Daughter\", Yoshiaki Kawajiri's \"Ninja Scroll\", Dorothy Sayers's \"Strong Poison\", Agatha Christie's \"Curtain\", the manhwa Roxana, the manga/anime Spy x Family, William Goldman's \"The Princess Bride\" (as well as its film adaptation), and the American historical series \"The Borgias\". In Michael Curtis Ford's historical novel \"The Last King\", on the life and conquests of Mithridates VI, the technique is used by Mithridates.", "It has been suggested that Russian mystic Rasputin's survival of a poisoning attempt was due to mithridatism, but this has not been proven. Indian epics talk about this practice as well. It has been said that, during the rule of the king Chandragupta Maurya (320–298 BC), there was a practice of selecting beautiful girls and administering poison in small amounts until they grew up, thus making them insensitive to poison. These maidens were called \"vishakanyas\" (visha 'poison' + kanya 'maiden'). It was believed that making love with vishakanyas could result in the death of their partners, hence they were employed to kill enemies. The emperor Bindusara was the son of the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya and his queen Durdhara. According to the \"Rajavalikatha\", a Jain work, the original name of this emperor was Simhasena. A legend mentioned in the Jain texts tells the story of how Chandragupta's Guru and advisor Chanakya used to feed the emperor with small doses of poison to build his immunity against possible poisoning attempts by his enemies. One day, Chandragupta, unaware that his food contained poison, shared his food with his pregnant wife, Queen Durdhara, who was seven days away from delivery. The queen, who was not immune to the poison, collapsed and died within a few minutes.", "A. E. Housman's \"Terence, this is stupid stuff\" (originally published in \"A Shropshire Lad\") invokes mithridatism as a metaphor for the benefit that serious poetry brings to the reader. The final section is a poetic rendition of the Mithridates legend.

The Flower Chariot) is a 1987 Indian black comedy silent film written and directed by Singeetam Srinivasa Rao, who co-produced it with Shringar Nagaraj. The film, which has no dialogue, stars Kamal Haasan leading an ensemble cast that includes Samir Khakhar, Tinu Anand, K. S. Ramesh, Amala, Farida Jalal, Pratap Potan, Lokanath, P. L. Narayana and Ramya. It revolves around an unemployed graduate who encounters a drunk rich man unconscious and takes over his lifestyle after keeping him prisoner. However, he does not realise the dangers he has brought upon himself because a hired killer believes him to be his target. Rao's desire to make a dialogue-less film came when he was working as an assistant director in a film where a character had to emote fear without dialogue in a scene. Once the idea for \"Pushpaka Vimana\" materialised, Rao wrote the screenplay within two weeks. The film was the only one produced by Nagaraj. Due to the lack of dialogue, Rao was able to cast actors from different parts of India. The cinematography was handled by B. C. Gowrishankar, editing by D. Vasu, art direction by Thota Tharani, and the background score was composed by L. Vaidyanathan. The film was shot in Bangalore, Karnataka.", "Seeing what the hotel owner achieved by fair means, the graduate begins to question his actions. He sees the roadside beggar has died, and municipality workers arrive to take away the body. However, discovering the beggar's stash, they abandon his body and squabble over the money. The graduate decides to stop his deceit. He frees the rich man and explains the situation to him in a letter. The rich man and his wife reunite, and he stops drinking. The graduate decides to come clean to the magician's daughter too. He learns the magician's family is about to leave Pushpak. He confesses the truth to the magician's daughter, and to his surprise she forgives him.

Development. Singeetam Srinivasa Rao was assisting director K. V. Reddy in a film where there was a scene requiring a character to emote fear without dialogues. Rao wondered if he could make an entire film that way for a long time, but did not have an idea for the story.", "The film was released on 27 November 1987 with different titles for different linguistic regions: its original title \"Pushpaka Vimana\" in Karnataka (in the Kannada language), \"Pushpaka Vimanam\" in Andhra Pradesh (Telugu), \"Pushpak\" (transl. Flower) in Hindi-speaking regions, \"Pesum Padam\" (transl. Talking Picture) in Tamil Nadu (Tamil), and \"Pushpakvimanam\" in Kerala (Malayalam). It received critical acclaim and became a commercial success, with a 35-week theatrical run in Bangalore. The film won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment as a Kannada entry and in three categories at the 35th Filmfare Awards South in the Kannada branch: Best Film, Best Director (Rao) and Best Actor (Haasan). Plot. An unemployed graduate living in a ramshackle lodge called Anand Bhavan dreams of riches. He tries to show off his meagre wealth in front of a roadside beggar but is then humbled to discover the beggar has accumulated more money than him. He meets a young woman trying on earrings in a fancy shop and then sees her again while waiting in line to apply for job vacancies. She mistakes the expensive car he is leaning against to be his, and he happily pretends she is right. One night, the graduate finds a drunk rich man unconscious by the roadside.", "The idea for the film that would become \"Pushpaka Vimana\" came to Rao when he was in a shower, after which he wrote the screenplay within two weeks. Kamal Haasan agreed to work on the film after being impressed by the script. According to him, the story was originally a tragedy, but after being inspired by Charlie Chaplin, he and Rao decided to change it to a tragicomedy. \"Pushpaka Vimana\" thus became the first full-length dialogue-less film in India after the \"silent era\" of cinema. The film struggled to find a producer, prompting Rao to take over production himself. When Kannada actor Shringar Nagaraj, a relative of Kannada matinee idol Rajkumar with whom Rao was working at that time, heard that Rao was producing a film on his own, he asked about the subject. Rao narrated \"Pushpaka Vimana\", Nagaraj showed excitement and joined as co-producer, with the film being produced under Mandakani Chitra, a company based in Bangalore, Karnataka. \"Pushpaka Vimana\" was the only film Nagaraj had produced in his entire career. Cinematography was handled by B. C. Gowrishankar, editing by D. Vasu, and art direction by Thota Tharani, who had worked with Rao on \"Raja Paarvai\" (1981). Casting. Since the film had no dialogue, Rao chose to cast actors from different parts of India.
