This was followed by the unveiling of the Sportwagon concept late that year, the production version of which was released in July 2008. Sedan. In 1999 Holden's designers and engineers began laying down the basics of a clean-sheet Commodore sedan. In the seven years of development the car became Holden's largest and most expensive project, representing an expenditure of approximately A$1.03 billion and 3.4 million kilometres (2.1 million miles) of testing.", "In 2004, two years before the release of the VE Commodore, Holden unveiled the Torana TT36 concept car at the Australian International Motor Show in Sydney. This concept previewed the production Commodore and allowed Holden to assess public response to its exterior design. Some production-ready components such as the steering wheel and the handbrake lever were integrated from the TT36 into the production VE. After completing the initial design sketches Holden's engineers quickly began work on developing the chassis. Opel discontinued the rear-wheel drive Omega in 2003. Holden, who used this platform for all earlier Commodore models, had two options: adopt another GM platform or create a new architecture. GM's new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform, which was set to debut in the Cadillac CTS, was offered to Holden's engineers, but they believed that it was unsuitable for the car's requirements. The shoulder width in the rear seat was too narrow. Holden chose to develop a new platform, the GM Zeta, which would also serve as the basis for several upcoming GM vehicles. The car features a double-pivot MacPherson strut front suspension and a four-link independent rear suspension, replacing the earlier MacPherson strut front and semi-trailing arm rear designs. Denny Mooney was appointed chairman of Holden in January 2004. One of Mooney's priorities was to improve the perceived quality issues that surrounded the previous generations of Commodores.

Title.", "Field Work (1979) is the fifth poetry collection by Seamus Heaney, who received the 1995 Nobel Prize in Literature. Background. \"Field Work\" was Heaney’s first collection of poetry since his most celebrated collection, \"North\" in 1975. \"Field Work\" can largely be read as record of Heaney’s four years (1972-1976) living in rural County Wicklow in the Republic of Ireland after leaving the violence of The Troubles. Heaney had previously been living in Belfast as a professor at Queen's University. Denis O’Donoghue has referred to this period as \"years of retreat only in the religious or monastic sense, a quiet time for thinking and renewal.

O’Donoghue writes: “Readers who want Heaney to go on writing political poems, as in \"North\", may be disappointed with \"Field Work\".\" In an interview with Henri Cole in the Fall 1997 volume of \"The Paris Review\", Heaney describes this collection: \"But even if Field Work was less obsessive, more formally rangy, full of public elegies and personal love poems and those Glanmore sonnets, it was still a proof that I could write poetry in my new situation.\" He also calls \"Field Work\" “one of my favorites. In its own way it was a book of change also; it moved me from the intensity of \"North\" to something more measured, in both formal and emotional terms.\" In the same interview, Heaney also said: “I tried very deliberately in \"Field Work\" to turn from a broody, phonetically self-relishing kind of writing to something closer to my own speaking voice. And I think that from \"Field Work\" onwards I have been following that direction.

Heaney originally wanted to name the work “Polder.” His editor, Charles Monteith, insisted that Heaney change the title because readers may not be able to pronounce the word. Heaney then wanted the title “Easter Water,” but this name was also discarded in favor of the final name: \"Field Work\". Heaney said of the final title: \"I gave \"Field Work\" that title partly because there’s an element of samplings in it. But I think there’s an opener note in it as well. What holds \"Field Work\" together—this is only my view of it—is a certain ease of the voice.\" Heaney also provided his own explanation of how all his titles came about: “What usually happens is that I start to look for one [a title] once a ‘critical mass’ of poems gets written. I find that if I have a working title at that stage – say when half a volume is in existence – the title itself can help in shaping, or at least inclining and suggesting, the poems to come.”\nReception.

The story of \"Aik Gunahoon Ka Shehr\" revolves around a young man (Ahmed Butt) fascinated by city life and the thrills it has to offer. Once there, unemployment eventually leads him to join a gang of blackmailers involved in sex crimes, in turn leading to his ruin. Controversy. When the team of Aik Gunahoon Ka Shehr approached the Pakistan Film Censor Board for a clearance certificate, objection was raised over the phrase Gunahoon Ka Shehr. Later the name was modified to Aik Gunahoon Ka Shehr. What exactly they aimed to achieve by this is still a mystery. Secondly, the members of the respected censor board charged that the film contained erotic scenes and dialogue. Consequently, the film appeared before a full board who chopped off several scenes and dialogues which they considered ‘unnecessary’ and ‘irrelevant’, resulting in the producer reshooting them. Annoyed, producer Saeed Iqbal presented his stand before the censor board members, stating that the story of the film depicts the true picture of youth today who indulge in sex and crime. \"The objection was unfair because already a number of Pakistani, Indian and English movies with sexual content are being exhibited at cinemas and cable networks throughout the country,\" he said.

Kidd had originally been commissioned as a privateer for England, but his behavior had strayed into outright piracy, and he hoped that his treasure could serve as a bargaining chip in negotiations to avoid punishment. His bid was unsuccessful, however, and Kidd was hanged as a pirate. In English fiction, there are three well-known stories that helped to popularize the myth of buried pirate treasure: \"Wolfert Webber\" (1824) by Washington Irving, \"The Gold-Bug\" (1843) by Edgar Allan Poe and \"Treasure Island\" (1883) by Robert Louis Stevenson. These stories differ widely in plot and literary treatment but are all based on the William Kidd legend.

Ritual circumambulation or parikrama around a stupa or cult image is important in Buddhism and Hinduism. Often the whole building was circumambulated, often many times. The Buddhist chaitya hall always allowed a path for this, and the Durga temple, Aihole (7th or 8th century) is a famous Hindu example.

This was one of the earliest battles involving gunpowder firearms and field artillery in the Indian subcontinent which were introduced by the Mughals in this battle. Babur defeated the Sultan of Delhi, Ibrahim Lodi, using a combination of tactics such as the use of firearms and cavalry charges. This battle marked the beginning of Mughal rule in India, and its aftermath had a significant impact on the political and social landscape of the country, establishing the Mughal Empire, which lasted for 331 years (1526-1857). Background. After losing Samarkand for the second time, Babur gave attention to conquer Hindustan as he reached the banks of the Chenab in 1519. Until 1524, his aim was to only expand his rule to Punjab, mainly to fulfil his ancestor Timur's legacy, since it used to be part of his empire.

A henge near Stonehenge containing concentric rings of postholes for standing timbers, discovered in 1922, was named Woodhenge by its excavators because of similarities with Stonehenge. The name woodhenge is also used for a series of timber circles found at the Native American site of Cahokia (Cahokia Woodhenge). The timber Seahenge in Norfolk was named as such by journalists writing about its discovery in 1998. In November 2004, a circle of postholes in diameter was found in Russia and publicised as the Russian Stonehenge.

The expedition consisted of Leichhardt, four Europeans, two Aboriginal guides, seven horses, 20 mules and 50 bullocks. The Europeans were Adolph Classen, Arthur Hentig, Donald Stuart and Thomas Hands, a ticket of leave holder who replaced Kelly at Henry Stuart Russell's Cecil Plains station. The Aboriginal guides were Wommai and Billy Bombat, from Port Stephens. The party was last seen on 3 April 1848 at Allan Macpherson's Cogoon run, an outlying part of Mount Abundance Station, west of Roma on the Darling Downs. Leichhardt's disappearance after moving inland, although investigated by many, remains a mystery. The expedition had been expected to take two to three years, but after no sign or word was received from Leichhardt it was assumed that he and the others in the party had died. The latest evidence suggests that they may have perished somewhere in the Great Sandy Desert of the Australian interior. Four years after Leichhardt's disappearance, the Government of New South Wales sent out a search expedition under Hovenden Hely. The expedition found nothing but a single campsite with a tree marked \"L\" over \"XVA\".

The first specimen, AMNH 5240, was discovered in 1911 by Barnum Brown in Red Deer River of Alberta and secured by him in the Fall of 1912. As well as an almost complete skeleton, the find was notable because impressions of much of the creature's skin had also survived. The specimen came from the Belly River Group of the province. The left or underside of the skeleton was preserved in carbonaceous clay, making it difficult to expose the skin to the elements. The skeleton was articulated and only missing about the last of the tail and front legs. Both scapulae and coracoids are preserved in position, but the rest of the front legs are gone (except for phalanges and pieces of the humeri, ulnae, and radii). Apparently, the remaining front legs were weathered or eroded away. Impressions of the integument were preserved covering over a large part of the skeleton’s outlining and shows the form of the body. Another specimen, AMNH 5338, was found in 1914 by Brown and Peter Kaisen.", "Both specimens are now housed in the American Museum of Natural History in their original death poses. The type species, \"Corythosaurus casuarius\", was named by Barnum Brown in 1914, based on the first specimen collected by him in 1912. AMNH 5240 is thus the holotype. In 1916, the original author, Brown, published a more detailed description that was also based on AMNH 5338, which is therefore the plesiotype. \"Corythosaurus\" is among many lambeosaurines that possess crests and it was the crest that lends \"Corythosaurus\" its name. The generic name \"Corythosaurus\" is derived from the Greek κόρυθος,(\"korythos\"), \"Corinthian helmet\", and means \"helmeted lizard\". The specific name, \"casuarius\", refers to the cassowary, a bird with a similar skull crest. The full binomial of \"Corythosaurus casuarius\" thus means \"Cassowary-like reptile, with a Corinthian helmet crest\". The two best preserved specimens of \"Corythosaurus\", found by Charles H. Sternberg in 1912, were lost on December 6, 1916, while being carried by the \"SS Mount Temple\" to the United Kingdom during World War I. They were being sent to Arthur Smith Woodward, a paleontologist of the British Museum of Natural History in England, when the ship transporting them was sunk by the German merchant raider in the middle of the ocean.", "Provincial government ministry protecting parks in Ontario\nOntario Parks is a branch of the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks in Ontario, Canada, that protects significant natural and cultural resources in a system of parks and protected areas that is sustainable and provides opportunities for inspiration, enjoyment and education. The Ontario Parks system covers over , which is about 10 per cent of the province's surface area or the equivalent of an area approximately equal to Nova Scotia. It falls under the responsibility and mandate of the province's Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks. It was formerly under the mandate of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. The Ontario Parks system has been used as a model for other parks systems in North America. This can be attributed to its delicate balance of recreation, preservation and conservation. Many parks in Ontario also offer a Natural Heritage Education program (also called interpretive services or visitor services). History. The Ontario Parks system began in 1893 with the creation of Algonquin Park, originally designed to protect loggers' interests from settlement. The management and creation of provincial parks came under the Department of Lands and Forests in 1954 and led to a period of accelerated park creation: a ninefold increase in the number of parks over the next six years. In the 1970s the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) was formed. The MNR expanded to include forestry operations within the province, becoming the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) in approximately 2010, and became more focused on Forestry and species protection and enforcement via Conservation Officers.

The methods of retracting and storing the roof vary across eras and manufacturers. A convertible car's design allows an open-air driving experience, with the ability to provide a roof when required. A potential drawback of convertibles is their reduced structural rigidity (requiring significant engineering and modification to counteract the side effects of almost completely removing a car's roof). The majority of convertible roofs are of a folding construction framework with the actual top made from cloth or other fabric. Other types of convertible roofs include retractable hardtops (often constructed from metal or plastic) and detachable hardtops (where a metal or plastic roof is manually removed and often stored in the trunk). Terminology. Other terms for convertibles include cabriolet, cabrio, drop top, drophead coupé, open two-seater, open top, rag top, soft top, spider, and spyder, although companies use many of these terms interchangeably. Thus, nomenclatural consistency is rare. The term cabriolet originated from a carriage cabriolet: \"a light, two-wheeled, one-horse carriage with a folding top, capable of seating two persons\"; however, the term is also used to describe other convertibles. In the United Kingdom, the historical term for a two-door convertible is drophead coupé, and a four-door convertible was called an all-weather tourer. History.", "Most of the early automobiles were open-air vehicles without any roof or sides. As car engines became more powerful by the end of the 19th century, folding textile or leather roofs (as had been used on victoria or landau carriages) began to appear on cars. Examples of early cars with roofs include the phaeton (a two-seat car with a temporary roof), the brougham or a coupé de ville, having an enclosed passenger compartment at the rear, while the driver sat in front either in the open, or the landaulet, where the driver has a fixed roof and the passenger compartment has a folding roof. Less expensive cars, such as the runabouts, sporting roadsters, or sturdy touring cars, remained either completely open air or were fitted with a rudimentary folding top and detachable clear side curtains. In the 1920s, when steel bodies began to be mass-produced, closed cars became available to the average buyer, and fully open cars began to disappear from the mainstream market. By the mid 1930s, the remaining small number of convertibles sold were high-priced luxury models. In 1939, Plymouth introduced the first mechanically operated convertible roof powered by two vacuum cylinders. Demand for convertibles increased as a result of American soldiers in France and the United Kingdom during World War II familiarizing themselves with small roadster cars, which were not available in the United States at that time. These roadsters included the MG Midget and Triumph Roadster. The convertible design was incorporated into the mass market unibody by Hudson in 1948.", "A \"soft top\" is made from a flexible textile material:\nOther materials are also used in the convertible top. By 1955, the most popular materials were latex and butyl rubber fabrics that each accounted for around 35% of the convertible top's weight, with others included vinyl (12%), jute (8%), along with rayon and acrylic fibers (Orlon), amounting to about 1% each in the compositions. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) material was used for many convertible tops. The material consists of two layers: a top layer made of PVC, which has a specific structure depending on the vehicle model, and a lower layer made of fabric (usually cotton). The collapsible textile roof section over an articulated folding frame may include linings such as a sound-deadening layer and/or an interior cosmetic lining, to hide the frame. The folded convertible mechanism with the top is called the stack. Designs that fold down to a lower stack height offer a smoother silhouette for the car with the top down while concealed side rails allow room for three passengers in the back seat such as on the 1967 Rambler Rebel convertible. Detachable hardtop. Rigid removable hardtops, many of which can be stored in a car's trunk/boot, have been available at least since the 1950s. These usually provide greater weatherproofing, soundproofing, and durability compared to fabric-based tops; some are available with integrated rear-window defrosters and windscreens.", "After the last Cadillac Eldorado convertible was made in 1976, the only factory convertibles sold in the United States were imported. Making convertibles on the assembly line was both expensive and time-consuming, thus not worth the problems needed to sell the limited number of cars. Specialized coachbuilders were contracted to make dealer-available cars such as the Targa top versions of the AMC Concord and Eagle \"Sundancer\" as well as the Toyota Celica \"Sunchaser\" as specialty models. American Sunroof Company (ASC), which was responsible for popularizing the sunroof option for regular body styles, converted a Buick Riviera into a full convertible that compelled General Motors to market it as part of the 1982 Buick models. Chrysler Corporation also introduced a convertible body style in its 1982 lines that was based on the K-Car. These models were the LeBaron, produced under Chrysler, and the 400, manufactured under Dodge. Ford reintroduced a convertible Mustang for 1983, while American Motors Corporation (AMC) added a convertible version of the Renault Alliance in 1984. In 1989, Mazda released the first generation Mazda MX-5 (called \"Miata\" in North America), which has become the best-selling convertible with over 1 million cars sold. Also in 1989, Toyota released the Toyota Soarer Aerocabin, which uses an electrically operated retractable hardtop roof. A total of 500 were produced. Models dedicated to the convertible body style include the Mazda MX-5, Porsche Boxster, and Opel Cascada. Roof types. Textile.", "United States automakers manufactured a broad range of convertible models during the 1950s and 1960s – from economical compact-sized models such as the Rambler American and the Studebaker Lark, to the more expensive models, such as the Packard Caribbean, Oldsmobile 98, and Imperial by Chrysler. Automakers often included a convertible body style as an available body style in a model range. Convertibles in the U.S. market peaked in sales around 1965, and fell in popularity over the next five years. Optional air conditioning was gradually becoming more popular, and the availability of sunroofs and T-tops limited the appeal of the open body style. Noise, leaks, and repairs associated with fabric tops also contributed to issues that many customers had. The popularity of convertibles was reduced by the increased travel speeds on roads (resulting in more wind and noise for occupants) and the emergence of more comprehensive vehicle crash safety standards in the United States. The market share of convertibles fell to two or three percent of total sales and the U.S. automakers discontinued the body style from their lineups. American Motors stopped making convertibles after the 1968 model year, Chrysler after 1971, Ford after 1973, and most divisions of General Motors after 1975. Cadillac held out until 1976, when they made about 14,000. The last 200 had a red, white, and blue motif and a dashboard plaque.

Before the game, England were heavy favorites against a hastily assembled U.S. team, which was composed of part-time players. The game's only goal was scored by Haitian-born U.S. center forward Joe Gaetjens. This game and the U.S. team were profiled by author Geoffrey Douglas in his book \"The Game of Their Lives\", which was made into a film of the same name (later renamed \"The Miracle Match\"). Background. The 1950 FIFA World Cup was England's World Cup debut, the Football Association having boycotted the previous three tournaments owing to a dispute with FIFA over payments made to amateur players, which had been resolved four years earlier. England and the United States were both drawn in Group 2, along with Spain and Chile: under the rules of the competition only the group winner from this four-nation round-robin would progress to the final stage. Each team had played one previous match in the group, England having beaten Chile 2–0 and the United States losing 3–1 to Spain. At the time, the English had a reputation as the \"Kings of Football\", with a post-war record of 23 wins, 4 losses, and 3 draws. They had beaten the Italians 4–0 and the Portuguese 10–0 in Lisbon two weeks before that.", "Incidentally, the England team which toured Canada beat the United States team preparing for the World Cup 1–0 at the Triborough Stadium in New York City on 19 June, 10 days before the World Cup match, courtesy of a Johnny Hancocks goal. The American team consisted of semi-professional players, most of whom had other jobs to support their families. Walter Bahr was a high school teacher, Frank Borghi drove a hearse for his uncle's funeral home and others worked as letter carriers or dishwashers. One player, Ben McLaughlin, had to withdraw from the tournament because he could not get time off work. The hastily assembled team had trained together only once, which happened to be on the day before they left for Brazil, against the touring English team featuring Matthews. (Matthews did not play in that game, as he was injured.) Three players—Joe Maca, Ed McIlvenny, and Joe Gaetjens, none of whom was a U.S. citizen—had been added to the roster just before that game. \"We have no chance,\" recently appointed coach Bill Jeffrey told the press; he also declared his players \"sheep ready to be slaughtered\". The English \"Daily Express\" newspaper wrote: \"It would be fair to give the U.S. three goals of a start.\" Match. First half. Although Walter Bahr regularly served as captain for the United States, Ed McIlvenny was selected for the role for this particular match \"because he was British\". England won the toss and elected to kick off.", "In comparison, the Americans, despite having reached the semi-finals of the inaugural 1930 World Cup, had lost their last seven international matches (including the 1934 World Cup and 1948 Summer Olympics) by the combined score of 45–2, including heavy losses to Italy (7–1), Norway (11–0) and Northern Ireland (5–0). The odds were 3–1 the English would win the Cup, and 500–1 for the U.S. The people from Belo Horizonte were eager to watch the English team, with 10,000 tickets sold along with 3,000 distributed to associates of Sete de Setembro Futebol Clube, then-owners of the newly inaugurated Estádio Independência. England had Stanley Matthews available, who was widely considered one of the best players in the world at the time, but he had not played with the English team in the three international matches before the World Cup (in fact, he had joined the team late, having been touring Canada as part of another group of English internationals). As such, the selection committee (consisting entirely of Arthur Drewry, then president of The Football League in England and later the president of FIFA) opted to stay with the team that had just defeated Chile. Matthews would be saved for later, supposedly more difficult, opponents. As there were no substitutes allowed in those days, Matthews watched the game with the other reserves.", "According to Bahr, \"The overwhelming majority was Brazilians, but they rooted for us the entire time. We didn't realize why until after. They [were] hoping we would beat England and that Brazil would not have to play England in the final game.\" Some locals even jumped a short wall to enter the stadium through the playing field. Second half. The U.S. played with renewed confidence as the second half opened, creating another scoring opportunity in the 54th minute. In the 59th minute England was awarded a direct free kick but Mortensen's shot was well saved by Borghi. But England began threatening again, and it was fifteen minutes before the Americans were able to get another shot. With eight minutes left, Charlie Colombo brought down Mortensen with an illegal tackle at the edge of the penalty area. England pleaded for a penalty kick, but the referee ruled it was outside the box. From Alf Ramsey's resulting free kick, Jimmy Mullen headed the ball for what he thought was a goal, but Borghi tipped it away at the last instant, and despite the protests of the English players, the referee ruled that the ball had not crossed the line and thus there was no goal. England did not threaten again, but the U.S. had one final chance in the 85th minute: Frank \"Peewee\" Wallace drew Williams out of position and fired a shot at the empty net, only to be denied by a sliding goal line clearance by Ramsey. Post-match. Remaining matches.", "Within ninety seconds, Stanley Mortensen sent a cross from the left wing to Roy Bentley, who let off a shot that was barely pushed aside by U.S. goalkeeper Frank Borghi. By the 12th minute, England had six clear shots on goal but could not convert, with two shots hitting the post, one just going over the top, and another brilliantly saved by Borghi. The U.S. struggled to move to the offense, and finally managed a shot on goal in the 25th minute, which was blocked by English goalkeeper Bert Williams. The English counterattacked with three successive clear shots at the goal in minutes 30, 31, and 32, but failed to score. Mortensen twice went over the crossbar, and Tom Finney's header to the top corner was tipped away by Borghi. In the 37th minute, Bahr took a long shot from 25 yards out, but as Williams moved to his right to intercept, Gaetjens dived headlong near the penalty spot, and grazed the ball enough to put it to the left of the English goalkeeper, whose momentum prevented him from changing direction, and into the back of the net. The crowd exploded as the U.S. improbably led 1–0. As the half drew to a close, Finney had a chance to equalize, but the whistle blew before he could shoot.

The group consisted of vocalist, guitarist and lyricist Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. Sumner and Hook formed the band after attending a June 1976 Sex Pistols concert. While Joy Division's first recordings were heavily influenced by early punk rock, they soon developed a sparse sound and style that made them one of the pioneering groups of the post-punk genre and movement. Their self-released 1978 debut EP \"An Ideal for Living\" drew the attention of the Manchester television personality Tony Wilson, who signed them to his independent label Factory Records. Their debut album \"Unknown Pleasures\", recorded with producer Martin Hannett, was released in 1979. Curtis struggled with personal problems, including a failing marriage, depression, and epilepsy. As the band's popularity grew, Curtis's health condition made it increasingly difficult for him to perform; he occasionally experienced seizures on stage. He died by suicide on the eve of what would have been the band's first North American tour in May 1980, aged 23. Joy Division's second and final album, \"Closer\", was released two months later; it and the single \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" became their highest-charting releases. Between July and October 1980, the remaining members, with the addition of keyboardist and guitarist Gillian Gilbert, regrouped under the name New Order. They were successful throughout the next decade, blending post-punk with electronic and dance music influences.", "In 2023, both Joy Division and New Order were nominated as one act for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. History. Formation. On 4 June 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\". The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\" Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \"Stiff Kittens\", but the band settled on \"Warsaw\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \"Warszawa\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier.", "Billed as Warsaw to ensure an audience, the band played their first gig as Joy Division on 25 January 1978 at Pip's Disco in Manchester. Early releases. Joy Division were approached by RCA Records to record a cover of Nolan \"N.F.\" Porter's \"Keep on Keepin' On\" at a Manchester recording studio. The band spent late March and April 1978 writing and rehearsing material. During the Stiff/Chiswick Challenge concert at Manchester's Rafters club on 14 April, they caught the attention of TV music presenter Tony Wilson and manager Rob Gretton. Curtis berated Wilson for not putting the group on his Granada Television show \"So It Goes\"; Wilson responded that Joy Division would be the next band he would showcase on TV. Gretton, the venue's resident DJ, was so impressed by the band's performance that he convinced them to take him on as their manager. Gretton, whose \"dogged determination\" was later credited for much of the band's public success, contributed the business skills to provide Joy Division with a better foundation for creativity. Joy Division spent the first week of May 1978 recording at Manchester's Arrow Studios. The band were unhappy with the Grapevine Records head John Anderson's insistence on adding synthesiser into the mix to soften the sound, and asked to be dropped from the contract with RCA.", "Joy Division made their recorded debut in June 1978 when the band self-released \"An Ideal for Living\", and two weeks later their track \"At a Later Date\" was featured on the compilation album \"\" (which had been recorded live in October 1977). In the \"Melody Maker\" review, Chris Brazier said that it \"has the familiar rough-hewn nature of home-produced records, but they're no mere drone-vendors—there are a lot of good ideas here, and they could be a very interesting band by now, seven months on\". The packaging of \"An Ideal for Living\"—which featured a drawing of a Hitler Youth member on the cover—coupled with the nature of the band's name fuelled speculation about their political affiliations. While Hook and Sumner later said they were intrigued by fascism at the time, Morris believed that the group's dalliance with Nazi imagery came from a desire to keep memories of the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents during World War II alive. He argued that accusations of neo-Nazi sympathies merely provoked the band \"to keep on doing it, because that's the kind of people we are\". On 20 September 1978, Joy Division made their television debut performing \"Shadowplay\" on \"So It Goes\", with an introduction by Wilson. In October, Joy Division contributed two tracks recorded with producer Martin Hannett to the compilation double-7\" EP \"A Factory Sample\", the first release by Tony Wilson's record label, Factory Records.", "Reviews in the \"NME\" by Paul Morley and in \"Sounds\" by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band the Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join the Panik, and even had Curtis audition. On 18 July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions. Driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off. In August 1977, Warsaw placed an advertisement in a music shop window seeking a replacement drummer. Stephen Morris, who had attended the same school as Curtis, was the sole respondent. Deborah Curtis, Ian's wife, stated that Morris \"fitted perfectly\" with the band, and that with his addition Warsaw became a \"complete 'family'\". To avoid confusion with the London punk band Warsaw Pakt, the band renamed themselves Joy Division in early 1978, borrowing the name from the sexual slavery wing of a Nazi concentration camp mentioned in the 1955 novel \"House of Dolls\".

Drawing heavily from the theories of literary-genre criticism, film genres are usually delineated by \"conventions, iconography, settings, narratives, characters and actors\". One can also classify films by the tone, theme/topic, mood, format, target audience, or budget. These characteristics are most evident in genre films, which are \"commercial feature films [that], through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations\" in a given genre. A film's genre will influence the use of filmmaking styles and techniques, such as the use of flashbacks and low-key lighting in film noir; tight framing in horror films; or fonts that look like rough-hewn logs for the titles of Western films. In addition, genres have associated film scoring conventions, such as lush string orchestras for romantic melodramas or electronic music for science fiction films. Genre also affects how films are broadcast on television, advertised, and organized in video rental stores. Alan Williams distinguishes three main genre categories: narrative, avant-garde, and documentary. With the proliferation of particular genres, film subgenres can also emerge: the legal drama, for example, is a sub-genre of drama that includes courtroom- and trial-focused films.", "Still Life was an American post-hardcore band originally from Moorpark, California, and then the San Fernando Valley, California.

Genres are not fixed; they change and evolve over time, and some genres may largely disappear (for example, the melodrama). Not only does \"genre\" refer to a type of film or its category, a key role is also played by the expectations of an audience about a film, as well as institutional discourses that create generic structures. Overview. Characteristics. Characteristics of particular genres are most evident in genre films, which are \"commercial feature films [that], through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations\" in a given genre. Drawing heavily from the theories of literary-genre criticism, film genres are usually delineated by conventions, iconography, narratives, formats, characters, and actors, all of which can vary according to the genre. In terms of standard or \"stock\" characters, those in film noir, for example, include the femme fatale and the \"hardboiled\" detective; while those in Westerns, stock characters include the schoolmarm and the gunslinger. Regarding actors, some may acquire a reputation linked to a single genre, such as John Wayne (the Western) or Fred Astaire (the musical)."], "distances": [0.4752538204193115, 0.5185296535491943, 0.5277027487754822, 0.5363587141036987, 0.5470324158668518], "supports": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "confidence": 0.762373, "abstained": true, "gate_abstain": false, "llm_abstain": true, "generation_ms": 1382, "total_ms": 3025, "hops_detail": [{"hop": 1, "query": "What genre is Still Life?", "confidence": 0.762373, "abstain": false}], "unanswerable": false}

It flows generally southeast out of the Llano Estacado and through the Texas Hill Country, then through several reservoirs including Lake J.B. Thomas, E.V. Spence Reservoir, and O.H. Ivie Lake. The river flows through several more reservoirs before reaching Austin, including Lake Buchanan, Inks Lake, Lake Lyndon B. Johnson (commonly referred to as Lake LBJ), and Lake Travis.

The two names would later be reversed. The upper Colorado River was controlled by Comanches from the early 18th century to the late 19th century. In 1757, Spanish Texas attempted to establish an outlying Catholic mission (Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá) on the San Saba River, near its confluence with the Colorado River. Nearly defenseless and viewed by the Comanche tribe as a territorial invasion, the mission was sacked in 1758 by about 2,000 Comanches and their allies. The Comanche were not effectively challenged on the upper Colorado River for nearly a century. River modifications. The river is an important source of water for farming, cities, and electrical power production. Major man-made reservoirs on the river include Lake Buchanan, Inks Lake, Lake LBJ, Lake Marble Falls, Lake Travis, Lake Austin, Town Lake now called Lady Bird Lake in Austin. Collectively, these lakes are known as the Highland Lakes. In addition to power plants operating on each of the major lakes, waters of the Colorado are used for cooling the South Texas Nuclear Project near Bay City. The Colorado River Municipal Water District owns and operates three reservoirs upstream of the Highland Lakes: Lake J. B. Thomas near Snyder, E.V. Spence Reservoir near Robert Lee, and O.H. Ivie Lake near Ballinger. Flood control and use of the Colorado River is managed by two agencies established by the Texas Legislature: the Upper Colorado River Authority and the Lower Colorado River Authority.", "There are 11 major reservoirs along the Colorado River.

Prasanna, Bishen Singh Bedi and Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan constituted the Indian spin quartet that dominated spin bowling during the 1960s and 1970s. At a very young age, polio left his right arm withered. Chandrasekhar played 58 Test matches, capturing 242 wickets at an average of 29.74 in a career that spanned sixteen years. He is one of only two test cricketers in history with more wickets than total runs scored, the other being Chris Martin. Chandrasekhar was awarded the Padmashri in 1972. He was named as a \"Wisden\" Cricketer of the Year in 1972; in 2002 he won Wisden's award for \"Best bowling performance of the century\" for India, for his six wickets for 38 runs against England at the Oval in 1971.

Chandrasekhar was born in 1945 in Mysore, where he had his primary education. He developed an early interest in cricket watching the playing styles of Australian leg spinner Richie Benaud. An attack of polio at the age of six left his right arm withered. At the age of 10, his hand had recovered and Chandrasekhar started playing cricket.", "By that time his family relocated to Bangalore and he got an opportunity to play for \"City Cricketers\". In an interview, Chandrasekhar stated that he joined up mainly to get a chance to play with the leather ball. While playing on the streets of Bangalore, he had mainly used a rubber ball. While playing for the club, Chandrasekhar tried different bowling styles that also included fast bowling. It was in 1963 that he decided to play as a leg spin bowler. His idea proved to be right as he was soon selected for the national side. Making his Test debut for India against England at Bombay in 1964, he collected four wickets in the match. He was named the \"Indian Cricket\" Cricketer of the Year the same year. Chandrasekhar was influential in setting up India's first victory in England when he picked up six wickets for 38 runs at The Oval in 1971; the bowling was named the \"Indian Bowling performance of the century\" by \"Wisden\" in 2002. \"Wisden\" noted that he was \"wonderfully accurate for a bowler of his type, and his extra pace made him a formidable proposition even on the sluggish Oval pitch.\" His consistent bowling performances in 1971 earned him being named one of the five \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Year in 1972. In a Test against New Zealand in 1976, Chandrasekhar and Prasanna took 19 wickets and were crucial in setting up India's win.", "Attributed to him is a famous umpire-directed quote, made during a day of bad decisions in New Zealand after several of his lbw appeals were given not out: \"I know he is bowled, but is he out?\" Chandrasekhar also played a major role in India's victory in Australia in 1977–78. During that series he became the first bowler to register identical figures in each innings of a test (6 for 52). Chandrasekhar had minimal batting skills, finishing with a Test average of 4.07. He was given a special Gray-Nicholls bat during the 1977–78 Australian tour with a hole in it to commemorate the four ducks he scored, and he has 23 Test ducks to his credit. He also holds the dubious distinction of scoring less runs (167) off his bat than wickets (242) taken in Test cricket; the only other cricketer with this distinction over a significant Test career is New Zealand fast bowler Chris Martin.

He likely studied with Palestrina, and was a skilled and prolific composer, especially of cyclic madrigals of the type popular in Rome. Life. Mel was born in Mechelen to an aristocratic family closely connected to the Duchy of Lorraine; his father was in charge of the financial management of the Duke's estate. In 1562, at the probable age of eight, he began study at the Cathedral of St. Rombaut, with Séverin Cornet being his principal teacher. In 1572, after finishing his schooling, he was sent to Lisbon by his family, where he may have served as \"maestro di cappella\" at the court (according to Giuseppe Baini, the 19th century writer on music, who was not always a reliable source). By 1580 he was in Rome, possibly studying with Palestrina. Records indicate he was at Chieti in 1583, and in January 1584 in Venice; in July of that year he accepted a position as \"maestro di cappella\" at Rieti Cathedral, but was dismissed shortly thereafter for being too often absent from his duties. Between 1585 and 1591 Mel traveled widely, returning to Flanders, including Liège and Antwerp. He served briefly as \"maestro di cappella\" for the Duke of Bavaria, then in Liège, for at least a few months beginning in July 1587.", "He visited Venice, Rome, Magliano Capo di Sabina, and Aquila during the years 1585 to 1591 as well. Between 1591 and 1597 he was music director at the cathedral and seminary in Magliano Capo di Sabina. He disappears from the record after 1597, but a book of newly composed chansons by him, published in Antwerp that year, has suggested that he may have again returned to the land of his birth. Music. All of Rinaldo del Mel's surviving music is vocal, and it is both sacred and secular. He was a prolific composer, and wrote both motets and madrigals, as well as some forms that blended elements of the sacred and secular, such as a collection of \"spiritual canzonets\". His style shows the craftsmanship of an exceptional Netherlandish musical training, as well as the influence of Palestrina, who was probably his teacher, as claimed by Baini. Mel's sacred music, as would be expected of a composer of the Roman School, is more conservative stylistically than his secular music. Since his music is yet to appear in a modern edition it has not been fully evaluated by scholars. Mel wrote several sets of cyclic madrigals, i.e. sets of madrigals which set successive stanzas of a long poem (Monteverdi's \"Sestina: Lagrime d'Amante al Sepolcro dell'Amata\" is probably the most famous example of a cyclic madrigal set).", "Rinaldo may refer to:\nSee also.

References. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;", "Setting cyclic madrigals was a hallmark of Roman School composers. Mel's settings show some progressive tendencies, such as an increasing melodic emphasis on the uppermost part, a feature which foreshadowed the polarization of soprano and bass parts that was a feature of the Baroque style several decades later.

It is owned by Gray Television alongside dual NBC/Telemundo affiliate KHNL (channel 13) and Kailua-Kona–licensed KFVE (channel 6), which relays KHNL's second and sixth digital subchannels. The stations share studios on Waiakamilo Road in Honolulu's Kapālama neighborhood; KGMB's transmitter is located in Akupu, Hawaii. History. The station first signed on the air on December 1, 1952, as the second television station in Hawaii. KGMB-TV was originally owned by J. Howard Worrall along with KGMB radio (AM 590, now KSSK) and operated from studios on Kapiolani Boulevard in Honolulu. The station carried programming from three of the four major networks at the time (excluding DuMont), but was a primary CBS affiliate owing to KGMB-AM's long affiliation with CBS Radio. The station lost NBC programming when KONA-TV (channel 2, now KHON-TV) signed on two weeks later, and lost ABC when KULA-TV (channel 4, now KITV) launched in April 1954. In 1973, a partnership led by future Hawaii congressman Cecil Heftel bought KGMB-AM-TV, then turned around and sold the KGMB stations to Lee Enterprises in 1977. Lee sold off the radio station in 1980.", "In 1982, the station dropped the \"-TV\" suffix from its call sign. The real-life KGMB news crew was often featured in one of the longest-running police dramas on CBS in the 1970s, \"Hawaii Five-O\". The station also had ties to the iconic series' reboot, as CBS allowed KGMB to let its viewers preview the season premiere episode early at the Waikiki Shell each September during the rebooted series' run. In 2000, Lee exited from television broadcasting and sold most of its television holdings (including KGMB) to Emmis Communications. Emmis already owned KHON-TV, so it had to obtain a cross-ownership waiver for the purchase of KGMB from the Federal Communications Commission, to bypass the recently passed duopoly rules that forbid common ownership of two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market. This waiver was renewed several times while Emmis owned both stations. At that time, KHON moved its operations into KGMB's facility, though the two stations maintained separate news departments. From September 2, 2002, to October 31, 2004, KGMB carried select UPN programming via a secondary affiliation shared with KHON; each station aired programs from that network that the other station did not air. The two stations began carrying UPN programming in September 2002 after KFVE (which had been with UPN since its January 1995 launch) disaffiliated from the network to become a full-time affiliate of The WB (whose programming aired on KFVE in a secondary capacity since December 1998).", "KIKU, an independent station specializing in Japanese programming, became a secondary UPN affiliate on November 1, 2004, and remained with the network until its closure on September 15, 2006. Emmis itself prepared to exit the television industry and sold KHON to the Montecito Broadcast Group in 2006. Emmis then announced on February 20, 2007, that KGMB and its satellites had been sold to MCG Capital Corporation for $40 million, resulting in one of the rare instances involving a complete separation of a television station duopoly. The FCC approved the sale in late May and was completed on June 4, 2007. Shortly after MCG Capital Corporation took over, KGMB adopted a logo similar to the one it used in the early 1980s and also rolled out a new graphics package for its newscast and a new website. For many years, KGMB billed itself as \"One of the Good Things About Hawaii\" with its rich history of local television programming exclusively in Hawaii, especially in such shows as \"Skipper Al\" and \"Checkers &amp; Pogo\" (both children's programs; the latter being the most remembered, airing from 1967 to 1982 and featured Morgan White), \"The Hawaii Moving Company\" (originally a disco/dance program that transitioned into a general interest show), and the 1982 television special \"Rap's Hawaii\" starring Rap Reiplinger. This slogan was made famous by an \"a cappella\" jingle which is still heard on KGMB today. At the end of KGMB's morning newscast, \"Sunrise\", it can now be heard leading into \"CBS Mornings\".", "Later, with an emphasis on weather, the station branded itself \"Hawaii's Severe Weather Station\". Channel swap. On August 18, 2009, MCG Capital and Raycom Media (owner of KHNL and, at the time, KFVE) announced a shared services agreement with Raycom as senior partner. As part of the deal, KGMB vacated its longtime studios on Kapiolani Boulevard; the combined operation would be based at KHNL/KFVE's studios on Waiakamilo Road. Though non-news programming would remain in place, news operations of the three stations would be combined into a single entity. The arrangement would also see a channel swap, with KGMB moving from virtual channel 9 (UHF digital channel 23) to channel 5 (UHF digital channel 22) and KFVE move from 5 to 9. The resulting ownership arrangement of the stations generated some controversy, as it had the effect of Raycom trading KFVE to MCG Capital in return for KGMB. Organizations such as media watchdog group Media Council Hawaii viewed the plan as a way to circumvent FCC rules preventing one company owning two of the four highest-rated stations in the same market—in this case, KGMB and KHNL. However, the FCC only recognizes ownership of facility identifications, which remain attached to their channel numbers, and not ownership of a station's intellectual unit (call letters, programming, network affiliation, etc.)."], "distances": [0.4581385850906372, 0.45831120014190674, 0.46957361698150635, 0.47768688201904297, 0.5441035032272339], "supports": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], "confidence": 0.770931, "abstained": true, "gate_abstain": false, "llm_abstain": true, "generation_ms": 1370, "total_ms": 3717, "hops_detail": [{"hop": 1, "query": "If KULA-TV hadn't commenced operations in 1954, which network's programming would KGMB-TV have continued to broadcast?", "confidence": 0.770931, "abstain": false}], "unanswerable": false}

After concluding that Maddox is worse than Kelso, Cox teams up with the Janitor and Kelso to oust her. After Maddox is fired, the position is vacant until Kelso, unbeknownst to Cox, recommends him for the job. Cox is initially hesitant to take the job out of fear of losing the connection he has with his patients. After a few days, Kelso convinces him to accept the position. In the Season 2 DVD commentary of \"His Story\", series creator Bill Lawrence stated that Cox always knows if someone is standing behind him, as well as who it is, without turning around to check. This quirk is subverted in \"My Finale\" when J.D. stands behind Cox as he tells one of the new interns how he really feels; throughout the speech, he gives no sign that he knows that J.D. is behind him. He is also a very good golfer, regularly besting Kelso.

While he goes out of his way to distance himself from others, Cox often gets mixed up in the lives of both his patients and those around him. This personal involvement often manifests in destructive ways, with Cox externalizing his feelings to those around him. Despite this, he has intervened in some situations to help others with no expectation of personal gain and often to his own detriment, like when he punches Kelso in the face in front of the entire staff when Kelso berates Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke). According to McGinley in the Season 1 DVD bonus features, Cox's habit of touching his nose is a homage to Paul Newman's character in \"The Sting\", although Cox also uses it as a sign of irritation on occasion, rather than just signifying \"it's going to be OK\", as in the film.

Its name is associated with the mythical condition of lycanthropy, a supernatural affliction in which humans are said to physically shapeshift into wolves. The term is used by researchers mostly in the broader sense of transformation into animals in general, that, strictly speaking, is described as zoanthropy. Signs and symptoms. Affected individuals believe that they are in the process of transforming into an animal, or have already transformed into an animal. Clinical Lycanthropy has been associated with the altered states of mind that accompany psychosis, the mental state that typically involves delusions and hallucinations, with the transformation only seeming to happen in the mind and behavior of the affected person. A 1988 study on clinical lycanthropy from the McLean Hospital reported on a series of cases, and proposed some diagnostic criteria by which clinical lycanthropy could be recognised:\nAccording to these criteria, either a delusional belief in current or past transformation or behavior that suggests a person thinks of themselves as transformed is considered evidence of clinical lycanthropy. The authors note that, although the condition seems to be an expression of psychosis, there is no specific diagnosis of mental or neurological illness associated with its behavioral consequences. Clinical lycanthropy is not specific to an experience of human-to-wolf transformation.", "A wide variety of creatures have been reported as part of the shape-shifting experience. A 2004 review of the medical literature lists over thirty published cases of clinical lycanthropy, only the minority of which have wolf (Lycanthropy) or dog (Cynanthropy) themes. Canines are certainly not uncommon, although the experience of being transformed into other animals such as a hyena, cat, horse, bird, or tiger has been reported on more than one occasion. Transformation into frogs, and even bees, has been reported in some instances. The term \"ophidianthropy\" refers to the delusion that one has been transformed into a snake, of which two case studies have been reported. In Japan, transformation into foxes and dogs was common (, ). A 1989 case study described how one individual reported a serial transformation, experiencing a change from human to dog, to a horse, and then to a cat, before returning to the reality of human existence after treatment. There are also reports of people who experienced transformation into an animal only listed as \"unspecified.\" Proposed mechanisms. Clinical lycanthropy is a very rare condition and is largely considered to be an idiosyncratic expression of a psychotic or dissociative episode caused by another condition such as Dissociative Identity Disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or clinical depression. It has also been associated with drug intoxication and withdrawal, cerebrovascular disease, traumatic brain injury, dementia, delirium, and seizures.", "However, there are suggestions that certain neurological conditions and cultural influences may result in the expression of the human-animal transformation theme that defines the condition. Neurological factors. One important factor may be differences or changes in parts of the brain known to be involved in representing body shape (e.g., see proprioception and body image). A neuroimaging study of two people diagnosed with clinical lycanthropy showed that these areas display unusual activation, suggesting that when people report their bodies are changing shape, they may be genuinely perceiving those feelings. Treatment. Because clinical lycanthropy is strongly associated with psychotic disorders, antipsychotic medication is often an effective treatment. It may also be treated with antidepressants or mood stabilizers, in cases in which it is a symptom of depression or bipolar disorder. Patients with clinical lycanthropy may also benefit from a cultural approach to treatment, as the syndrome is generally agreed to be culture-bound. Related disorders. Clinical lycanthropy is a type of delusional misidentification syndrome of the self, and it often overlaps with other delusional misidentification syndromes. For example, there is a case study of a psychiatric patient who had both clinical lycanthropy and Cotard delusion. In rare cases, individuals may believe that other people have transformed into animals. This has been termed \"lycanthropic intermetamorphosis\" and \"lycanthropy spectrum.\"", "A 2009 study reported that, after the consumption of the drug MDMA (Ecstasy), a man displayed symptoms of paranoid psychosis by claiming that his relatives had changed into various animals such as a boar, a donkey, and a horse. History. Catherine Clark Kroeger has written that several parts of the Bible refer to King Nebuchadnezzar's behavior in the book of Daniel 4 as being a manifestation of clinical lycanthropy. Neurologist Andrew J. Larner has written that the fate of Odysseus's crew due to the magic of Circe may be one of the earliest examples of clinical lycanthropy. It is believed that the Armenian king Tiridates III also had this disorder. He was cured by Gregory the Illuminator. According to Persian tradition, the Buyid prince Majd al-Dawla was experiencing an illusion that he was a cow. He was cured by Ibn Sina. Notions that lycanthropy was due to a medical condition go back to the seventh century, when the Alexandrian physician Paulus Aegineta attributed lycanthropy to melancholia or an \"excess of black bile\". In 1563, a Lutheran physician named Johann Weyer wrote that werewolves had an imbalance in their melancholic humour and exhibited the physical symptoms of paleness, \"a dry tongue and a great thirst\" as well as sunken, dim and dry eyes.", "Even King James VI and I in his 1597 treatise \"Daemonologie\" does not blame werewolf behaviour on delusions created by the Devil but \"an excess of melancholy as the culprit which causes some men to believe that they are wolves and to 'counterfeit' the actions of these animals\". The perception of an association between mental illness and animalistic behaviour can be traced throughout the history of folklore from many different countries. Case examples. On August 15, 2016, Martin County Florida Sheriff's Office deputies found a 19-year-old male on top of a bloodied 59-year-old man, gnawing on his face, eating pieces of flesh, and making growling sounds. Officers tased, repeatedly kicked, and ultimately required a police dog's assistance in subduing the 19-year-old. Inside the garage of the home on Southeast Kokomo Lane, just north of the Palm Beach County line, deputies found a 53-year-old woman, beaten, bloodied and unresponsive. Ultimately both the 59-year-old man and 53-year-old woman would die from their injuries. In the weeks ahead of this incident, the 19-year-old told family members he believed he was either half-man, half-horse or half-man, half-dog. Clinical psychologist Dr. Phillip Resnick later assessed the 19-year-old as having clinical lycanthropy.

The US is ranked first in crop export volume; almost 50% of its total wheat production is exported. The United States Department of Agriculture defines eight official classes of wheat: durum wheat, hard red spring wheat, hard red winter wheat, soft red winter wheat, hard white wheat, soft white wheat, unclassed wheat, and mixed wheat. Winter wheat accounts for 70 to 80 percent of total production in the US, with the largest amounts produced in Kansas (10.8 million tons) and North Dakota (9.8 million tons). The US hard red spring wheat crop is exported to over 70 countries each year to the extent of 55%. Of the total wheat produced in the country, 50% is exported, valued at US$9 billion. History. According to Ricardo Alegria, wheat was first cultivated in New Spain by afro-spanish conquistador Juan Garrido in the 16th century. Although it was first introduced to the Western Hemisphere following the discovery of the New World, wheat came to be grown in North American soil only during the colonial period. During the colonial period, wheat was sown by broadcasting, reaped by sickles, and threshed by flails. The kernels were then taken to a grist mill for grinding into flour.", "It is not known whether the unapproved wheat is present elsewhere. Geography. In the North American plains, the wheat production axis that extends over a length of in a north–south direction from central Alberta to central Texas is known as the Wheat Belt. Hard red winter wheat is grown in the Central U.S. states of Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, Oklahoma, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, and Texas and Some Northwestern United States such as Washington, Oregon and Idaho. In the hot climatic conditions of these states, winter wheat is raised by planting in fall and harvesting in the spring, taking advantage of autumn rains. Under harsh cold weather conditions in parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota where winter wheat cannot be grown, the crop is planted in the spring and grows during the long summer days of the high latitudes so that it can be harvested in the fall. Classification and uses. Of wheat grown in the United States, 36% percent is consumed domestically by humans, 50% is exported, 10% is used for livestock feed, and 4% is used for seedlings. Various American-style wheat beers are produced in the US. Wheat in the U.S. is grown under two major categories based on climate: winter wheat, and spring wheat. The majority is winter wheat, accounting for, on average, 75% of wheat production. Wheat may be further classified as follows:\nThe byproducts resulting from milling of all the above varieties is used to feed animals. Enrichment.", "In 1830, it took four people and two oxen, working 10 hours a day, to produce 200 bushels. The geographic center of wheat-growing areas in the U.S. in 1839 was to the north and west of Washington, D.C., and spread further over time to the far west of the country. Production conditions also resulted in extending the wheat growing areas into harsher climatic regions. Data on wheat production is available for the period between 1885 and 1930. Improvements in wheat breeding in the U.S. was an activity of the state agricultural experiment stations, while the federal officials concentrated on exploring possibilities of gaining from appropriate varieties developed in other parts of the world. After the American Civil War, the western Mississippi Valley and the Great Plains to its west, where large fertile lands were available, resulted in expanding wheat farming. By this time, better tillage equipment was in use, railroads provided better access to world markets, better trading and warehousing facilities were facilitated, and more particularly introduction of hard winter was introduced. In the 1870s, Turkey red wheat, a hard variety of wheat, was introduced to the farmlands of Kansas by Russian Mennonite immigrants. This wheat variety spread quickly. New technology substantially enhanced productivity in the 19th century, as sowing with drills replaced broadcasting, cradles took the place of sickles, and the cradles in turn were replaced by reapers and binders. Steam-powered threshing machines superseded flails.", "By 1895, in Bonanza farms in the Dakotas, it took six different people and 36 horses pulling huge harvesters, working 10 hours a day, to produce 20,000 bushels. Following the invention of the steel roller mill in 1878, hard varieties of wheat such as Turkey Red became more popular than soft, which had been previously preferred because they were easier for grist mills to grind. Exports from 1914 to 1922 amounted to more than 200 million bushels. The annual wheat production of the United States more than tripled in the fifty years between 1871 and 1921; it increased from about 250 million bushels during the period of 1869–1871 to over 750 million during the period of 1919–1921. With recorded wheat production of more than its domestic consumption (production was as much as 2.5 times the consumption), as World War II started, wheat stocks could not be lifted and the result was its use as livestock feed and for industrial alcohol. After the war years, there were four \"best\" years (1945–1948) when the average annual production peaked to 1,228 million bushels, double the production of war years. In 2002, 50% of the U.S. wheat crop was exported, while 36% was consumed by the American population, and 10% was fed to livestock, with the remaining 4% set aside for seed. Wheat harvesting occurs on land area of 60–63 million acres. Genetically modified wheat, which \"is not approved for cultivation anywhere in the world\", was found in an Oregon farm in June 2013. The grain was modified by Monsanto to tolerate weed killer treatments.", "In 1941, the wheat industry began to adopt voluntary widespread enrichment (fortification) of wheat flour with vitamins, folic acid, and iron, the outcome of a recommendation by the National Nutrition Conference for Defense, charged with investigating the causes of poor health among many World War II recruits. By 1942, some 75 percent of breads in the United States were fortified. Mandatory fortification requirements went into effect in 1943, following the publication of the first U.S. government recommended dietary allowances. The removal of naturally occurring nutrients that occurs in grain processing led to a number of diseases caused by nutritional deficiency, including beriberi, pellagra, neural tube defect, and iron deficiency anemia. Enrichment helped eradicate or reduce the frequency of these conditions in the United States. Policy. Under the Wilson administration during World War I, the U.S. Food Administration, under the direction of Herbert Hoover, set a basic price of $2.20 per bushel. The end of the war led to \"the closing of the bonanza export markets and the fall of sky-high farm prices\", and wheat prices fell from more than $2.20 per bushel in 1919 to $1.01 in 1921. The McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill failed in Congress, and was followed by the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929, the establishment of the Federal Farm Board, and the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933. The most important legislation for wheat production in the United States today are the farm bills which authorized farm subsidies, the Conservation Reserve Program, and other programs."], "distances": [0.3143346905708313, 0.340639591217041, 0.39518874883651733, 0.46665555238723755, 0.596870481967926], "supports": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "confidence": 0.842833, "abstained": false, "gate_abstain": false, "llm_abstain": false, "generation_ms": 2325, "total_ms": 4522, "hops_detail": [{"hop": 1, "query": "where do they grow wheat in the us", "confidence": 0.842833, "abstain": false}], "unanswerable": false, "cited_indices": [2], "gold_indices": [1], "citation_precision": 0.0, "citation_recall": 0.0}

The American Academy of Ambulatory Care Nursing (AAACN) describes ambulatory care nursing as a comprehensive practice which is built on a broad knowledge base of nursing and health sciences, and applies clinical expertise rooted in the nursing process. Ambulatory care nurses use evidence based information across a variety of outpatient health care settings to achieve and ensure patient safety and quality of care while improving patient outcomes. Contact with patients in ambulatory care is often relatively brief, and in the context of a high volume of patients. Nurses in this setting require sound assessment skills and the ability to guide patients in making informed health choices.

This care can include advanced medical technology and procedures even when provided outside of hospitals. Ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) are health conditions where appropriate ambulatory care prevents or reduces the need for hospital admission (or \"inpatient\" care), such as diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Many medical investigations and treatments for acute and chronic illnesses and preventive health care can be performed on an ambulatory basis, including minor surgical and medical procedures, most types of dental services, dermatology services, and many types of diagnostic procedures (e.g. blood tests, X-rays, endoscopy and biopsy procedures of superficial organs). Other types of ambulatory care services include emergency visits, rehabilitation visits, and in some cases telephone consultations. Ambulatory care services represent the most significant contributor to increasing hospital expenditures and to the performance of the health care system in most countries, including most developing countries.

Safety. There have been concerns regarding the safety of ambulatory medicine. Some of the common potential sources of harm include errors to medications and diagnostics as well as breakdowns in communications and coordination of care. One major complication of ambulatory care that predisposes to patients to harm is the risk for missing appointments. Missed appointments are common, costly, and can lead to significant delays in both diagnosis and treatment. Advancements in information technology (IT) have helped to address some safety concerns of ambulatory medicine by minimizing mismanagement of electronic health records (EHR), improving interoperability, and increasing health professionals communication. Some have raised the notion of designing health professionals payment policies with greater focus on safety in addition to patient volumes. Furthermore, strategies for increased patient and caregiver engagement have been heralded as potentially beneficial in both patient care as well as data gathering for patient safety.

Unemployed Arthur lives in Walford with his wife Pauline (Wendy Richard), their son Mark (David Scarboro and Todd Carty) and daughter Michelle (Susan Tully) and Pauline's mother Lou Beale (Anna Wing). Pauline is pregnant with her third child, and gives birth to a son, Martin Fowler (Jon Peyton Price, James Alexandrou and James Bye). Arthur's greatest pleasure is gardening and he obtains a spot in the local allotment, which he regularly uses as a foil to escape his nagging wife and his equally nagging mother-in-law. Over the years Arthur finds a steady stream of odd jobs to keep him occupied. He works for Tony Carpenter (Oscar James) as a carpenter's helper, deliveryman and as a road sweeper in the market. For a brief period in 1986, he is also employed by Walford Cleaning Services to clean the local schools. Lou dies in 1988.", "Their next move, secured by their agent Joe Collins (father of Joan Collins and Jackie Collins), was to the ATV show \"Sunday Night at the London Palladium\", which at the time was the most important variety show on UK television. Due to their popularity they were invited to appear before Queen Elizabeth II at the 1962 Royal Variety Show. In 1963 they starred alongside Frankie Howerd and Tommy Cooper in the Michael Winner film \"The Cool Mikado\". By 1965, their act was a great success, thanks in part to the ABC shows \"Big Night Out\" and its follow-up, \"Blackpool Night Out\". Features of their act were that Mike would appear on stage first, often playing the clarinet. Bernie would then poke his head through a curtain and say \"Eeeeh! \", followed by him pulling Mike's cheeks and calling him \"choochy-face\". Bernie also had the cheery catchphrase \"I'll smash yer face in\". In appearance, Mike was slightly built and sharply dressed, whilst Bernie was larger and displayed his slightly protruding front teeth to produce a mildly gormless and 'goofy' look. The brothers were rewarded with their own show that ran from 1965 to 1973. On Mothering Sunday, 24 March 1974, they again appeared on \"Sunday Night at the London Palladium\". The following year they appeared as guest stars on \"The Peters and Lee Story\" on ATV on 27 December 1975.", "The cast included the author Lionel Bart himself, Alfie Bass, Adam Faith, Harry Fowler, Joan Heal, Sidney James, Alfred Marks, Marion Ryan, Tony Tanner, and the Williams Singers.

His friend Nick Adams was called in to do some voice dubbing for Dean's role. In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Plot. In the mid-1920s, wealthy Texas rancher Jordan \"Bick\" Benedict Jr. (Rock Hudson) travels to Maryland on a horse-buying trip. He meets socialite Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), and they marry and return to the Benedicts' Texas cattle ranch, Reata. Bick's older sister, Luz, runs the household and resents Leslie's intrusion.

The first part of the picture was actually shot in Albemarle County, Virginia, and used the Keswick, Virginia, railroad station as the Ardmore railway depot.

It is their first studio album since 1996's \"Stars and Stripes Vol. 1\", the first album to feature original material since \"Summer in Paradise\" in 1992, their first album to feature guitarist and backing vocalist David Marks since \"Little Deuce Coupe\" in 1963, and their first album since the 1998 death of co-founder Carl Wilson.

Background. Jim Peterik has said that the album's title came from a comment made by Brian in response to Peterik's description of an AM radio broadcast filtering through a car's oval speaker. According to record producer Joe Thomas, Brian Wilson circa 2008 or 2010 inquired to him about demo tapes recorded during the sessions for Wilson's 1998 solo album \"Imagination\" which Thomas co-produced: \"He called up and said I've got some ideas for some new Beach Boys songs, and I said, That’s great, and I pointed out to him that when we worked together several years ago he had the genesis of some other Beach Boys songs that he had never really wanted to put on any of his solo records.", "That he had isolated specifically for the Beach Boys. So he asked me to compile those and it was more than a few.\" One of these demos was an early version of the then-future title track \"That's Why God Made the Radio\". Some of these early demos reportedly even featured vocals from Carl Wilson. The two proceeded to meet with Mike Love in Palm Springs, who then agreed to a collaboration. In the late 2000s, reports began to circulate that the surviving members of the Beach Boys would reunite for a 50th Anniversary tour and album. Despite some uncertainty and initial denials, on December 16, 2011, it was announced that Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston and David Marks would reunite for a new album and The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour. The studio reunion was kicked off by a remake of the band's 1968 single, \"Do It Again\", recorded earlier that May. The next day, the group recorded the album's opening track, \"Think About the Days\". Composition. Wilson and Love discussed the upcoming album and tour in an interview on February 16, 2012. The duo said the album was halfway done with Wilson doing most of the writing and stating that all of the songs will flow into each other. Wilson considers the title track, \"That's Why God Made the Radio\", to be one of the group's best. The album ends with a \"Pet Sounds\"- and \"Smile\"-inspired suite.", "It just seemed like all these little pieces became like this theme, and instead of being Americana or whatever \"Smile\" was, it was his drive down Pacific Coast Highway. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSometimes he’ll have a great chorus and I’ll just add a couple lines in a verse.

And sometimes he won’t say anything, and then all of sudden he’ll come up with this brilliant melody while I’m playing the chords. —Joe Thomas\nMany of the songs were written in collaboration with Thomas, whose input sometimes included entire chord progressions. Classified as baroque pop, many of the songs have a considerable history: \"That's Why God Made the Radio\" was written by Brian Wilson, Jim Peterik, Joe Thomas and Larry Millas back in the late 1990s, and that \"about 80 hours worth\" of demo tapes were sourced from that period. \"Spring Vacation\" originated during \"Your Imagination\" and contained new lyrics by Love written reportedly in five minutes. The track \"Summer's Gone\" was originally meant to be the final song on the final Beach Boys album, and according to Thomas, the album's original title was \"Summer's Gone\" with the intention that it would be the final Beach Boys album.", "In early 2008, they co-wrote ten songs in a week during the band's Look Me in the Eyes Tour.

Speaking of the experience of co-producing, Nick Jonas said: \"Being able to co-produce was really cool and definitely something we'll be doing a lot more of.\" Nick also complimented working with Lovato. The album was recorded in ten and a half days in Fields' home studio in May 2008. The inspiration behind \"Get Back\", a Jonas-penned track, was Lovato not wanting to write a mean or heartbroken song as she felt that there was enough of them. Instead, Lovato wanted to write about getting back together with an old boyfriend. \"It's kind of a fun, upbeat song and it's kind of just fun to sing to the person that I wrote it about\", Lovato said of the song. \"La La Land\" was written by Lovato and the Jonas Brothers about \"the pressures of fame\". Lovato said, \"You get to Hollywood and a lot of times people can try to shape you and mould you into what they want you to be. The song is just about keeping it real and trying to stay yourself when you're out in Hollywood\".", "Bryan told \"The Boot\" that the song is about \"a guy meeting a girl, and it's the first night that they're hanging out. It's a magical night and he doesn't want it to end. It's got a big fun chorus in it.\" He co-wrote the song with Rhett Akins, Dallas Davidson, and Ben Hayslip, collectively known as The Peach Pickers. After Hayslip provided the title, Bryan began playing a melody on a guitar. Hayslip then said that his publisher, Randy Gaston, recommended that he write \"a song that talks about putting your hands up in the chorus\". The song is set in the key of A minor and has a moderate tempo of approximately 112 beats per minute.

She said that she identified with the feelings that might lead someone to use heroin: \"I've been in that place where you've messed up and you're so lost that you don't know who you are anymore, and you're miserable—and here's this escape route. I've never done heroin, but I've done plenty of other things to escape.\" She said that the song is about \"trying not to take responsibility for other people's problems and trying to love yourself at the same time\". Composition. The song has a sparse arrangement, with only three instruments used: a piano played by McLachlan, a drum machine programmed by Pierre Marchand, and upright bass played by Jim Creeggan of Barenaked Ladies. It was recorded in the key of D-flat major. For live performances, it is transposed up one half-step to D major, the key it was originally written in, and played without the bass.

Chichén Itzá was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or \"Tollans\", referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site. The ruins of Chichén Itzá are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History).", "Traditional Yucatec Maya spelling in Latin letters, used from the 16th through mid 20th century, spelled it as \"Chichen Itza\" (as accents on the last syllable are usual for the language, they are not indicated as they are in Spanish). The word \"Itzaʼ\" has a high tone on the \"a\" followed by a glottal stop (indicated by the apostrophe). Evidence in the Chilam Balam books indicates another, earlier name for this city prior to the arrival of the Itza hegemony in northern Yucatán. While most sources agree the first word means seven, there is considerable debate as to the correct translation of the rest. This earlier name is difficult to define because of the absence of a single standard of orthography, but it is represented variously as \"Uuc Yabnal\" (\"Seven Great House\"), \"Uuc Hab Nal\" (\"Seven Bushy Places\"), \"Uucyabnal\" (\"Seven Great Rulers\") or \"Uc Abnal\" (\"Seven Lines of Abnal\"). This name, dating to the Late Classic Period, is recorded both in the book of Chilam Balam de Chumayel and in hieroglyphic texts in the ruins. Location. Chichén Itzá is located in the eastern portion of Yucatán state in Mexico. The northern Yucatán Peninsula is karst, and the rivers in the interior all run underground.", "The current belief trend in Maya scholarship is toward the more traditional model of the Maya kingdoms of the Classic Period southern lowlands in Mexico. Economy. Chichén Itzá was a major economic power in the northern Maya lowlands during its apogee. Participating in the water-borne circum-peninsular trade route through its port site of Isla Cerritos on the north coast, Chichen Itza was able to obtain locally unavailable resources from distant areas such as obsidian from central Mexico and gold from southern Central America. Between AD 900 and 1050 Chichén Itzá expanded to become a powerful regional capital controlling north and central Yucatán. It established Isla Cerritos as a trading port. History. The layout of Chichén Itzá site core developed during its earlier phase of occupation, between 750 and 900 AD. Its final layout was developed after 900 AD, and the 10th century saw the rise of the city as a regional capital controlling the area from central Yucatán to the north coast, with its power extending down the east and west coasts of the peninsula. The earliest hieroglyphic date discovered at Chichen Itza is equivalent to 832 AD, while the last known date was recorded in the Osario temple in 998. Establishment. The Late Classic city was centered upon the area to the southwest of the Xtoloc cenote, with the main architecture represented by the substructures now underlying the Las Monjas and Observatorio and the basal platform upon which they were built. Ascendancy. Chichén Itzá rose to regional prominence toward the end of the Early Classic period (roughly 600 AD).", "The land under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of Yucatán. Chichén Itzá is one of the most visited archeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in 2017. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nName and orthography. The Maya name \"Chichen Itza\" means \"At the mouth of the well of the Itza.\" This derives from \"chi\"', meaning \"mouth\" or \"edge\", and \"chʼen\" or \"chʼeʼen\", meaning \"well\". \"Itzá\" is the name of an ethnic-lineage group that gained political and economic dominance of the northern peninsula. One possible translation for Itza is \"enchanter (or enchantment) of the water,\" from \"its\" (itz), \"sorcerer\", and \"ha\", \"water\". The name is spelled \"Chichén Itzá\" in Spanish, and the accents are sometimes maintained in other languages to show that both parts of the name are stressed on their final syllable. Other references prefer the modern Maya orthography, \"Chichʼen Itzaʼ\" (pronounced ). This form preserves the phonemic distinction between \"chʼ\" and \"ch\", since the base word \"chʼeʼen\" (which, however, is not stressed in Maya) begins with a postalveolar ejective affricate consonant.", "There are four visible, natural sink holes, called cenotes, that could have provided plentiful water year round at Chichen, making it attractive for settlement. Of these cenotes, the \"Cenote Sagrado\" or \"Sacred Cenote\" (also variously known as the Sacred Well or Well of Sacrifice), is the most famous. In 2015, scientists determined that there is a hidden cenote under the Temple of Kukulkan, which has never been seen by archeologists. According to post-Conquest sources (Maya and Spanish), pre-Columbian Maya sacrificed objects and human beings into the cenote as a form of worship to the Maya rain god Chaac. Edward Herbert Thompson dredged the Cenote Sagrado from 1904 to 1910, and recovered artifacts of gold, jade, pottery and incense, as well as human remains. A study of human remains taken from the Cenote Sagrado found that they had wounds consistent with human sacrifice. Political organization. Several archeologists in the late 1980s suggested that unlike previous Maya polities of the Early Classic, Chichén Itzá may not have been governed by an individual ruler or a single dynastic lineage. Instead, the city's political organization could have been structured by a \"multepal\" system, which is characterized as rulership through council composed of members of elite ruling lineages. This theory was popular in the 1990s, but in recent years, the research that supported the concept of the \"multepal\" system has been called into question, if not discredited."], "distances": [0.31255602836608887, 0.33699607849121094, 0.39314794540405273, 0.3941470980644226, 0.4792938828468323], "supports": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "confidence": 0.843722, "abstained": false, "gate_abstain": false, "llm_abstain": false, "generation_ms": 1225, "total_ms": 2853, "hops_detail": [{"hop": 1, "query": "where is the chichen itza located in mexico", "confidence": 0.843722, "abstain": false}], "unanswerable": false, "cited_indices": [1, 2], "gold_indices": [1], "citation_precision": 0.5, "citation_recall": 1.0}

In 1941 there was a strike against the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, of which Duke Ellington was a member. Because of the strike he could not air his songs on the radio. Instead, he used songs written by his son Mercer and pianist Billy Strayhorn. Strayhorn's compositions of this time include \"Take the 'A' Train\", \"Chelsea Bridge\" and \"Day Dream\". Mercer wrote \"Things Ain't What They Used to Be\", \"Blue Serge\" and \"Moon Mist\".

They reached the quarter-finals, beating several longer-established clubs on the way. In 1883, Albion won their first trophy, the Staffordshire Cup. Albion joined the Football Association in the same year; this enabled them to enter the FA Cup for the first time in the 1883–84 season.

His \"Life and Typography of William Caxton, England's First Printer\", was published in 1861–1863, and the conclusions which he set forth were arrived at by a careful examination of types in the early books, each class of type being traced from its first use to the time when, spoilt by wear, it passed out of Caxton's hands. Some 450 volumes from the Caxton Press were thus carefully compared and classified in chronological order. In 1877 Blades took an active part in organizing the Caxton celebration, and strongly supported the foundation of the Library Association. He was a keen collector of old books, prints and medals. His publications relate chiefly to the early history of printing. The \"Enemies of Books\" was his most popular work, being produced in 1880. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1882. On his death, his library was acquired by the St Bride Foundation as the initial collection of the library.", "English percussionist (1901–1999)\nJames Blades OBE (9 September 1901 – 19 May 1999) was an English percussionist. He was one of the most distinguished percussionists in Western music, with a long and varied career. His book \"Percussion Instruments and their History\" (1971) is a standard reference work on the subject. Blades was born in Peterborough in 1901. He was a long-time associate of Benjamin Britten, with whom he conceived many of the composer's unusual percussion effects. In 1954, Blades was appointed Professor of Percussion at the Royal Academy of Music. As a chamber musician he played with the Melos Ensemble and the English Chamber Orchestra. Blades' pupils included the rock drummers Max Sedgley, Carl Palmer, and Richard James Burgess as well as percussionist Evelyn Glennie. His most famous and widely heard performances were the sound of the drum playing \"V-for-Victory\" in Morse code, the introduction to the BBC broadcasts made to the European Resistance during World War II, and providing the sound of the gong seen at the start of films produced by the Rank Organisation. Blades played this sound on a tam-tam. On screen Blades's sound was interpreted by an actor miming a character called the \"Gongman\". His autobiography \"Drum Roll: A Professional Adventure from the Circus to the Concert Hall\" was published by Faber &amp; Faber in 1977.

Drawing heavily from the theories of literary-genre criticism, film genres are usually delineated by \"conventions, iconography, settings, narratives, characters and actors\". One can also classify films by the tone, theme/topic, mood, format, target audience, or budget. These characteristics are most evident in genre films, which are \"commercial feature films [that], through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations\" in a given genre. A film's genre will influence the use of filmmaking styles and techniques, such as the use of flashbacks and low-key lighting in film noir; tight framing in horror films; or fonts that look like rough-hewn logs for the titles of Western films. In addition, genres have associated film scoring conventions, such as lush string orchestras for romantic melodramas or electronic music for science fiction films. Genre also affects how films are broadcast on television, advertised, and organized in video rental stores.

Broader examples include the docufiction and docudrama, which merge the basic categories of fiction and non-fiction (documentary). Genres are not fixed; they change and evolve over time, and some genres may largely disappear (for example, the melodrama). Not only does \"genre\" refer to a type of film or its category, a key role is also played by the expectations of an audience about a film, as well as institutional discourses that create generic structures. Overview. Characteristics. Characteristics of particular genres are most evident in genre films, which are \"commercial feature films [that], through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations\" in a given genre. Drawing heavily from the theories of literary-genre criticism, film genres are usually delineated by conventions, iconography, narratives, formats, characters, and actors, all of which can vary according to the genre. In terms of standard or \"stock\" characters, those in film noir, for example, include the femme fatale and the \"hardboiled\" detective; while those in Westerns, stock characters include the schoolmarm and the gunslinger. Regarding actors, some may acquire a reputation linked to a single genre, such as John Wayne (the Western) or Fred Astaire (the musical).", "Some genres have been characterized or known to use particular formats, which refers to the way in which films are shot (e.g., 35 mm, 16 mm or 8 mm) or the manner of presentation (e.g., anamorphic widescreen). Genres can also be classified by more inherent characteristics (usually implied in their names), such as settings, theme/topic, mood, target audience, or budget/type of production. Screenwriters, in particular, often organize their stories by genre, focusing their attention on three specific aspects: atmosphere, character, and story. A film's atmosphere includes costumes, props, locations, and the visceral experiences created for the audience. Aspects of character include archetypes, stock characters, and the goals and motivations of the central characters. Some story considerations for screenwriters, as they relate to genre, include theme, tent-pole scenes, and how the rhythm of characters' perspective shift from scene to scene. History. From the earliest days of cinema in the 19th century the term \"genre\" (already in use in English with reference to works of art or literary production from at least 1770) was used to organize films according to type. By the 1950s André Bazin was discussing the concept of \"genre\" by using the Western film as an example; during this era, there was a debate over auteur theory versus genre. In the late 1960s the concept of genre became a significant part of film theory. Film genres draw on genres from other forms; Western novels existed before the Western film, and musical theatre pre-dated film musicals.", "The perceived genre of a film can change over time; for example, in the 21st century \"The Great Train Robbery\" (1903) classes as a key early Western film, but when released, marketing promoted it \"for its relation to the then-popular genres of the chase film, the railroad film and the crime film\". A key reason that the early Hollywood industrial system from the 1920s to the 1950s favoured genre films is that in \"Hollywood's industrial mode of production, genre movies are dependable products\" to market to audiences – they were easy to produce and it was easy for audiences to understand a genre film. In the 1920s to 1950s, genre films had clear conventions and iconography, such as the heavy coats worn by gangsters in films like \"Little Caesar\" (1931). The conventions in genre films enable filmmakers to generate them in an industrial, assembly-line fashion, an approach which can be seen in the James Bond spy-films, which all use a formula of \"lots of action, fancy gadgets, beautiful woman and colourful villains\", even though the actors, directors and screenwriters change. Pure and hybrid genres. Films are rarely purely from one genre, which is in keeping with the cinema's diverse and derivative origins, it being a blend of \"vaudeville, music-hall, theatre, photography\" and novels. American film historian Janet Staiger states that the genre of a film can be defined in four ways.

The American Academy of Ambulatory Care Nursing (AAACN) describes ambulatory care nursing as a comprehensive practice which is built on a broad knowledge base of nursing and health sciences, and applies clinical expertise rooted in the nursing process. Ambulatory care nurses use evidence based information across a variety of outpatient health care settings to achieve and ensure patient safety and quality of care while improving patient outcomes. Contact with patients in ambulatory care is often relatively brief, and in the context of a high volume of patients. Nurses in this setting require sound assessment skills and the ability to guide patients in making informed health choices.

Safety. There have been concerns regarding the safety of ambulatory medicine. Some of the common potential sources of harm include errors to medications and diagnostics as well as breakdowns in communications and coordination of care. One major complication of ambulatory care that predisposes to patients to harm is the risk for missing appointments. Missed appointments are common, costly, and can lead to significant delays in both diagnosis and treatment. Advancements in information technology (IT) have helped to address some safety concerns of ambulatory medicine by minimizing mismanagement of electronic health records (EHR), improving interoperability, and increasing health professionals communication. Some have raised the notion of designing health professionals payment policies with greater focus on safety in addition to patient volumes. Furthermore, strategies for increased patient and caregiver engagement have been heralded as potentially beneficial in both patient care as well as data gathering for patient safety.

Historically, it is attested on cuneiform tablets from Mesopotamia, in ancient Egyptian texts and later Coptic texts, in the Greco-Roman world, in Syriac texts, in the European Middle Ages and early modern period, and among all Jewish groups who co-existed with these groups. The exact definition of what constitutes 'love magic' can be difficult to establish and will vary from scholar to scholar, but a common theme shared by many is the use of magic to start, preserve, or break up a relationship of some type whether for purely sexual or romantic purposes or both. The tools and methods used in its practice do not significantly differ from the way other forms of magic are practiced and include spoken and written spells and incantations, dolls, talismans, amulets, potions, and rituals. As most surviving sources concern love between men and women, there is a strong heterosexual bias when discussing these sources, though there are a few examples known to concern love between both two men and two women, such as Greek curse tablets. Love magic motifs appear in literature and art and in the mythologies of many cultures. It is less likely to occur in modern fiction, except in fantasy fiction (like \"Harry Potter\"), though even then it is not common and may be portrayed as negative. Ancient love magic in cuneiform.

At the time, the Egyptians believed that the heart was the origin of many channels that connected different parts of the body to each other and transported air – as well as urine, blood, and the soul – between them. The Edwin Smith Papyrus (1700 BCE), named for American Egyptologist Edwin Smith (1822 – 1906 CE) who purchased the scroll in 1862, provided evidence that Egyptians believed that the heartbeat created a pulse that transported the above substances throughout the body. A second scroll, the Ebers Papyrus (c. 1550 BCE), also emphasized the importance of the heart and its connection to vessels throughout the body and described methods to detect cardiac disease through pulse abnormalities. Although they had knowledge of the heartbeat, vessels, and pulse, the Egyptians attributed the movement of substances through the vessels to air that resided in these channels, rather than to the heart's exertion of pressure. The Egyptians knew that air played an important role in circulation but did not yet have a conception of the role of the lungs.

Drawing heavily from the theories of literary-genre criticism, film genres are usually delineated by \"conventions, iconography, settings, narratives, characters and actors\". One can also classify films by the tone, theme/topic, mood, format, target audience, or budget. These characteristics are most evident in genre films, which are \"commercial feature films [that], through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations\" in a given genre. A film's genre will influence the use of filmmaking styles and techniques, such as the use of flashbacks and low-key lighting in film noir; tight framing in horror films; or fonts that look like rough-hewn logs for the titles of Western films. In addition, genres have associated film scoring conventions, such as lush string orchestras for romantic melodramas or electronic music for science fiction films. Genre also affects how films are broadcast on television, advertised, and organized in video rental stores. Alan Williams distinguishes three main genre categories: narrative, avant-garde, and documentary. With the proliferation of particular genres, film subgenres can also emerge: the legal drama, for example, is a sub-genre of drama that includes courtroom- and trial-focused films.", "The perceived genre of a film can change over time; for example, in the 21st century \"The Great Train Robbery\" (1903) classes as a key early Western film, but when released, marketing promoted it \"for its relation to the then-popular genres of the chase film, the railroad film and the crime film\". A key reason that the early Hollywood industrial system from the 1920s to the 1950s favoured genre films is that in \"Hollywood's industrial mode of production, genre movies are dependable products\" to market to audiences – they were easy to produce and it was easy for audiences to understand a genre film. In the 1920s to 1950s, genre films had clear conventions and iconography, such as the heavy coats worn by gangsters in films like \"Little Caesar\" (1931). The conventions in genre films enable filmmakers to generate them in an industrial, assembly-line fashion, an approach which can be seen in the James Bond spy-films, which all use a formula of \"lots of action, fancy gadgets, beautiful woman and colourful villains\", even though the actors, directors and screenwriters change. Pure and hybrid genres.

These books feature the characters Sara Linton, Will Trent, and Lena Adams. The audiobook version is narrated by Natalie Ross. Plot summary. Broken begins with the murder of college student Allison Spooner. When the body is pulled from frigid Lake Grant, detective Lena Adams and her often drunk boss, interim Chief of Police Frank Wallace, follow a trail that leads to the suicide of the prime suspect, Tommy Braham, in his jail cell. The suicide spurs the involvement of Dr. Sara Linton, back in town for Thanksgiving with her family. Still incredibly angry with Lena over her role in Sara's husband's death, and convinced Lena's callous and reckless behavior has led to the possibly innocent suspect's death, Sara calls in back-up from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Upon arriving in town, Agent Will Trent immediately meets with resistance from the Grant County Police Department. Despite the roadblocks, he unveils serious errors and deliberate cover-ups in the investigation, perpetrated mainly by Frank Wallace. Soon after, Allison's boyfriend Jason is brutally killed in his dorm room. This definitively points to a murderer still on the loose, clearing Tommy Braham of any lingering suspicion.", "At one stage the film was going to be called \"South of the Amazon\".

Later he developed an interest in background score and shifted to Chennai, where he was introduced to films. He entered the film industry by playing orchestra for the popular Malayalam film song \"Naalikerathinte\" from the movie Thurakkatha Vathil. His first film composition was the song \"Oshana Oshana\" for the movie Jesus in 1973. It was P. Jayachandran who suggested HMV to record Ranganath's first stage song. Jayachandran himself sang those songs. So as a gratitude Ranganath called Jayachandran to sing for his first film song.

All of Rinaldo del Mel's surviving music is vocal, and it is both sacred and secular. He was a prolific composer, and wrote both motets and madrigals, as well as some forms that blended elements of the sacred and secular, such as a collection of \"spiritual canzonets\". His style shows the craftsmanship of an exceptional Netherlandish musical training, as well as the influence of Palestrina, who was probably his teacher, as claimed by Baini. Mel's sacred music, as would be expected of a composer of the Roman School, is more conservative stylistically than his secular music. Since his music is yet to appear in a modern edition it has not been fully evaluated by scholars. Mel wrote several sets of cyclic madrigals, i.e. sets of madrigals which set successive stanzas of a long poem (Monteverdi's \"Sestina: Lagrime d'Amante al Sepolcro dell'Amata\" is probably the most famous example of a cyclic madrigal set)."], "distances": [0.4678284525871277, 0.4678284525871277, 0.5445454716682434, 0.5473839044570923, 0.5538866519927979], "supports": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "confidence": 0.766086, "abstained": true, "gate_abstain": false, "llm_abstain": true, "generation_ms": 705, "total_ms": 6036, "hops_detail": [{"hop": 1, "query": "Who was the composer of E?", "confidence": 0.70433, "abstain": true}, {"hop": 2, "query": ": Who wrote the music for the film *E*?", "confidence": 0.766086, "abstain": false}], "unanswerable": true}

Broader examples include the docufiction and docudrama, which merge the basic categories of fiction and non-fiction (documentary). Genres are not fixed; they change and evolve over time, and some genres may largely disappear (for example, the melodrama). Not only does \"genre\" refer to a type of film or its category, a key role is also played by the expectations of an audience about a film, as well as institutional discourses that create generic structures. Overview. Characteristics. Characteristics of particular genres are most evident in genre films, which are \"commercial feature films [that], through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations\" in a given genre. Drawing heavily from the theories of literary-genre criticism, film genres are usually delineated by conventions, iconography, narratives, formats, characters, and actors, all of which can vary according to the genre. In terms of standard or \"stock\" characters, those in film noir, for example, include the femme fatale and the \"hardboiled\" detective; while those in Westerns, stock characters include the schoolmarm and the gunslinger. Regarding actors, some may acquire a reputation linked to a single genre, such as John Wayne (the Western) or Fred Astaire (the musical).", "Classification of films based on similarities in narrative elements\nA film genre is a stylistic or thematic category for motion pictures based on similarities either in the narrative elements, aesthetic approach, or the emotional response to the film. Drawing heavily from the theories of literary-genre criticism, film genres are usually delineated by \"conventions, iconography, settings, narratives, characters and actors\". One can also classify films by the tone, theme/topic, mood, format, target audience, or budget. These characteristics are most evident in genre films, which are \"commercial feature films [that], through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations\" in a given genre. A film's genre will influence the use of filmmaking styles and techniques, such as the use of flashbacks and low-key lighting in film noir; tight framing in horror films; or fonts that look like rough-hewn logs for the titles of Western films. In addition, genres have associated film scoring conventions, such as lush string orchestras for romantic melodramas or electronic music for science fiction films. Genre also affects how films are broadcast on television, advertised, and organized in video rental stores. Alan Williams distinguishes three main genre categories: narrative, avant-garde, and documentary. With the proliferation of particular genres, film subgenres can also emerge: the legal drama, for example, is a sub-genre of drama that includes courtroom- and trial-focused films.", "Person who has committed a sex crime\nA sex offender (sexual offender, sex abuser, or sexual abuser) is a person who has committed a sex crime. What constitutes a sex crime differs by culture and legal jurisdiction. The majority of convicted sex offenders have convictions for crimes of a sexual nature; however, some sex offenders have simply violated a law contained in a sexual category. Some of the serious crimes which result in a mandatory sex-offender classification are sexual assault, statutory rape, bestiality, child sexual abuse, incest, and rape. Some sex offenders are deemed too dangerous to society to be released and are subjected to civil confinement — indefinite continuing incarceration, which is supposed to, but does not always, provide meaningful treatment to the offender. Sex offender registration laws in the United States may also classify less serious offenses as sexual offenses requiring sex offender registration. In some states public urination, having sex on a beach, or unlawful imprisonment of a minor also constitute sexual offenses. Overview. In looking at various types of offenses, an example of a digital obscenity offense is child pornography. In the modern world of technology, many jurisdictions are reforming their laws to prevent the over-prosecution of sex offenders and focusing on crimes involving a victim. The term \"sexual predator\" is often used to describe a sex offender or any of the \"tier offenders\"; however, only the category just below sexually violent sexual predator is reserved for a severe or repeated sex offender: sexual predator.

Total return swaps are an example of an off-balance-sheet item. Some companies may have significant amounts of off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities. For example, financial institutions often offer asset management or brokerage services to their clients. The assets managed or brokered as part of these offered services (often securities) usually belong to the individual clients directly or in trust, although the company provides management, depository or other services to the client. The company itself has no direct claim to the assets, so it does not record them on its balance sheet (they are off-balance-sheet assets), while it usually has some basic fiduciary duties with respect to the client. Financial institutions may report off-balance-sheet items in their accounting statements formally, and may also refer to \"assets under management\", a figure that may include on- and off-balance-sheet items.
