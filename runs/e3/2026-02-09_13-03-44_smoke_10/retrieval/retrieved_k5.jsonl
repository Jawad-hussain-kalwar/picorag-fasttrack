She sets up an appointment to meet with bankers in New York City, but then breaks down when she realizes that she cannot live without Jim. She has the police track down which way he went and drives off after him. She eventually finds him (at another shooting gallery) and tells him that she is willing to get married. Then, he realizes that they can fly to New York in time to save her company. Even so, she tells him that he will run the firm, while she desires to have nine children. Production. Three directors worked on this film. William Dieterle began it, and William Wellman took over to complete it when Dieterle became ill. When Warner's production head, Jack L. Warner, decided he did not like an actor in the film, Wellman was not available because he had starting shooting \"College Coach\", so Michael Curtiz was brought in to re-shoot with Johnny Mack Brown as the replacement. Curtiz ended up with the sole screen credit.", "Producer Sam Raimi called it \"only the greatest idea for a sequel I've ever heard. I'm not kidding.\" In November 2018, Álvarez discussed sequels to both his \"Don't Breathe\" and \"Evil Dead\", saying, \"They're just ideas right now. Nothing to announce officially. We do have a script for \"Don't Breathe 2\". That's the only difference. We don't have a script for \"Evil Dead 2\". But we do have a script for \"Don't Breathe 2\" that we wrote.\" He also said, \"When I tweeted that I was interested in seeing what people prefer. We were having some internal debates about what people would be interested in most. Unfortunately, \"Evil Dead 2\" won. Which, I guess I would have preferred \"Don't Breathe 2\" to win because it's one of my own creations. Obviously \"Evil Dead\" has the bigger following.\" In January 2020, Álvarez was replaced as director by Rodo Sayagues, the co-writer of both \"Don't Breathe\" films, making his directorial debut. In a March 2021 interview, Stephen Lang stated that in preparation for reprising the role of Norman Nordstrom, he worked with The Northeastern Association for the Blind in Albany, New York to accurately depict the mannerisms of someone afflicted with being blind. Principal photography began on August 7, 2020, in Belgrade, Serbia, with Pedro Luque serving as cinematographer, returning from the previous film.", "This account and reports by Spanish explorers of the trade network of the Pueblos and others eventually evolved into the folklore of the Seven Cities of Gold. The 1609 Nahuatl-language \"Crónica Mexicayotl\" made the identification of New Mexico and Aztlán explicit, describing how the Mexica people left \"their home there in Old Mexico Aztlan Quinehuayan Chicomoztoc, which today they call New Mexico ().\" Following their conquest of the Aztecs in the early 16th century, the Spanish began exploring what is now the Southwestern United States calling it \"Nuevo México\". In 1581, the Chamuscado and Rodríguez Expedition named the region north of the Rio Grande \"San Felipe del Nuevo México\". The Spaniards had hoped to find wealthy indigenous cultures similar to the Mexica. The indigenous cultures of New Mexico, however, proved to be unrelated to the Mexica and lacking in riches, but the name persisted. Before statehood in 1912, the name \"New Mexico\" loosely applied to various configurations of territories in the same general area, which evolved throughout the Spanish, Mexican, and U.S. periods, but typically encompassed most of present-day New Mexico along with sections of neighboring states.

Before the game, England were heavy favorites against a hastily assembled U.S. team, which was composed of part-time players. The game's only goal was scored by Haitian-born U.S. center forward Joe Gaetjens. This game and the U.S. team were profiled by author Geoffrey Douglas in his book \"The Game of Their Lives\", which was made into a film of the same name (later renamed \"The Miracle Match\"). Background. The 1950 FIFA World Cup was England's World Cup debut, the Football Association having boycotted the previous three tournaments owing to a dispute with FIFA over payments made to amateur players, which had been resolved four years earlier. England and the United States were both drawn in Group 2, along with Spain and Chile: under the rules of the competition only the group winner from this four-nation round-robin would progress to the final stage. Each team had played one previous match in the group, England having beaten Chile 2–0 and the United States losing 3–1 to Spain. At the time, the English had a reputation as the \"Kings of Football\", with a post-war record of 23 wins, 4 losses, and 3 draws. They had beaten the Italians 4–0 and the Portuguese 10–0 in Lisbon two weeks before that.", "Incidentally, the England team which toured Canada beat the United States team preparing for the World Cup 1–0 at the Triborough Stadium in New York City on 19 June, 10 days before the World Cup match, courtesy of a Johnny Hancocks goal. The American team consisted of semi-professional players, most of whom had other jobs to support their families. Walter Bahr was a high school teacher, Frank Borghi drove a hearse for his uncle's funeral home and others worked as letter carriers or dishwashers. One player, Ben McLaughlin, had to withdraw from the tournament because he could not get time off work. The hastily assembled team had trained together only once, which happened to be on the day before they left for Brazil, against the touring English team featuring Matthews. (Matthews did not play in that game, as he was injured.) Three players—Joe Maca, Ed McIlvenny, and Joe Gaetjens, none of whom was a U.S. citizen—had been added to the roster just before that game. \"We have no chance,\" recently appointed coach Bill Jeffrey told the press; he also declared his players \"sheep ready to be slaughtered\". The English \"Daily Express\" newspaper wrote: \"It would be fair to give the U.S. three goals of a start.\" Match. First half. Although Walter Bahr regularly served as captain for the United States, Ed McIlvenny was selected for the role for this particular match \"because he was British\". England won the toss and elected to kick off.", "In comparison, the Americans, despite having reached the semi-finals of the inaugural 1930 World Cup, had lost their last seven international matches (including the 1934 World Cup and 1948 Summer Olympics) by the combined score of 45–2, including heavy losses to Italy (7–1), Norway (11–0) and Northern Ireland (5–0). The odds were 3–1 the English would win the Cup, and 500–1 for the U.S. The people from Belo Horizonte were eager to watch the English team, with 10,000 tickets sold along with 3,000 distributed to associates of Sete de Setembro Futebol Clube, then-owners of the newly inaugurated Estádio Independência. England had Stanley Matthews available, who was widely considered one of the best players in the world at the time, but he had not played with the English team in the three international matches before the World Cup (in fact, he had joined the team late, having been touring Canada as part of another group of English internationals). As such, the selection committee (consisting entirely of Arthur Drewry, then president of The Football League in England and later the president of FIFA) opted to stay with the team that had just defeated Chile. Matthews would be saved for later, supposedly more difficult, opponents. As there were no substitutes allowed in those days, Matthews watched the game with the other reserves.", "According to Bahr, \"The overwhelming majority was Brazilians, but they rooted for us the entire time. We didn't realize why until after. They [were] hoping we would beat England and that Brazil would not have to play England in the final game.\" Some locals even jumped a short wall to enter the stadium through the playing field. Second half. The U.S. played with renewed confidence as the second half opened, creating another scoring opportunity in the 54th minute. In the 59th minute England was awarded a direct free kick but Mortensen's shot was well saved by Borghi. But England began threatening again, and it was fifteen minutes before the Americans were able to get another shot. With eight minutes left, Charlie Colombo brought down Mortensen with an illegal tackle at the edge of the penalty area. England pleaded for a penalty kick, but the referee ruled it was outside the box. From Alf Ramsey's resulting free kick, Jimmy Mullen headed the ball for what he thought was a goal, but Borghi tipped it away at the last instant, and despite the protests of the English players, the referee ruled that the ball had not crossed the line and thus there was no goal. England did not threaten again, but the U.S. had one final chance in the 85th minute: Frank \"Peewee\" Wallace drew Williams out of position and fired a shot at the empty net, only to be denied by a sliding goal line clearance by Ramsey. Post-match. Remaining matches.", "Within ninety seconds, Stanley Mortensen sent a cross from the left wing to Roy Bentley, who let off a shot that was barely pushed aside by U.S. goalkeeper Frank Borghi. By the 12th minute, England had six clear shots on goal but could not convert, with two shots hitting the post, one just going over the top, and another brilliantly saved by Borghi. The U.S. struggled to move to the offense, and finally managed a shot on goal in the 25th minute, which was blocked by English goalkeeper Bert Williams. The English counterattacked with three successive clear shots at the goal in minutes 30, 31, and 32, but failed to score. Mortensen twice went over the crossbar, and Tom Finney's header to the top corner was tipped away by Borghi. In the 37th minute, Bahr took a long shot from 25 yards out, but as Williams moved to his right to intercept, Gaetjens dived headlong near the penalty spot, and grazed the ball enough to put it to the left of the English goalkeeper, whose momentum prevented him from changing direction, and into the back of the net. The crowd exploded as the U.S. improbably led 1–0. As the half drew to a close, Finney had a chance to equalize, but the whistle blew before he could shoot. The crowd, initially 10,000, increased as Brazilian locals heard radio coverage of the match. The spectators were mostly supporting the underdog Americans, cheering with Borghi's saves and the unsuccessful English attacks."], "distances": [0.31872105598449707, 0.3674009442329407, 0.3971846103668213, 0.40029996633529663, 0.4328080415725708], "supports": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "metadatas": [{"support": 1, "mapped_id": "020a7518-0292-4399-8560-d73be630f881", "pool_index": 2240, "doc_name": "United States v England (1950 FIFA World Cup)"}, {"mapped_id": "020a7518-0292-4399-8560-d73be630f881", "doc_name": "United States v England (1950 FIFA World Cup)", "pool_index": 2242, "support": 0}, {"mapped_id": "020a7518-0292-4399-8560-d73be630f881", "support": 0, "doc_name": "United States v England (1950 FIFA World Cup)", "pool_index": 2241}, {"support": 0, "pool_index": 2244, "doc_name": "United States v England (1950 FIFA World Cup)", "mapped_id": "020a7518-0292-4399-8560-d73be630f881"}, {"mapped_id": "020a7518-0292-4399-8560-d73be630f881", "pool_index": 2243, "doc_name": "United States v England (1950 FIFA World Cup)", "support": 0}], "recall": 1.0, "precision": 0.2, "ndcg": 1.0, "mrr": 1.0}
